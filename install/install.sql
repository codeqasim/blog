Facebook is one of the biggest and most popular social media sites. It is being used by millions of people every minute, so you have bright chances to target the desired audience with powerful Facebook campaigns. Here we have described the Facebook marketing mistakes small travel agencies often make.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Wrong Broadcasting</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the small travel agencies and start up businesses suffer because of wrong type of broadcasting. For this, you are highly recommended to ask a social media marketer about the effective broadcasting. Remember that in any situation, you should engage your fans. Create page and run ads on them to get more and more daily visitors. Both relevant and irrelevant content can attract their eyes until or unless they are informative and useful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Broadcasting alone cannot help</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here we would like to make one thing clear that your job is to interact with the global audience, so broadcasting alone is not going to help. Fans look for a reason to get connected with you. It is in your hands that how you keep them engaged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Know how Facebook helps you to make money</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course Facebook is an authentic social media site where you can make a lot of money everyday. You just need to know how this is possible. Businesses immediately run their ad campaings and their representatives stay connected with the people through Facebook communities. From every point and aspect, your focus has to be on engaging more and more people because this will eventually help you to make extra income, no matter which part of the world you live in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Not Investing Adequate Time</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ask yourself this question that &lsquo;are you investing adequate time&rsquo;? Once you get the answer, you can be clear with how to use Facebook to catch the attention of audience. This mistake is often done by many of us. Many social media consultants say that they see a pervasive &ldquo;set it and forget it&rdquo; mentality of the businessmen. If you are doing the same then let me tell you that it will lead you nowhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Traditional advertising methods</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you using the traditional advertising methods? If it is so then it is time to change your mind and methods completely. Facebook is a giant social media from where you can make as much as you want. The wise of ad campaigns is the only way your business can survive. At the same time, remember to keep your Facebook pages alive &ndash; which mean the audience remains engaged round the clock thus you can achieve big success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Being Boring or Predictable</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stop being boring or predictable. While doing social media marketing, you cannot say anything for sure. Some business owners make far more money than the others. Facebook is the platform for all of us, so no one can keep its facilities and features restricted to his business. You just need to stop being boring and predictable. Keep on working for your own success, and do not get jealous of what others are doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With these things in mind, you can definitely achieve the desired goals.</p>\r\n', 'facebook marketing mistake, travel agency facebook marketing mistakes,  Facebook Marketing Mistakes Small Travel Agencies Make', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5f3f7dea0b656.jpg', 5098, '2019-07-30 15:08:24'),

If it is so, then you need to avoid a couple of mistakes. It is understandable that the startup businessmen are making mistakes, but remember that if they are too serious you can suffer from loses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here we are going to discuss a few common mistakes that can sink a bootstrapped travel agency. Look at these pitfalls and consult experts of the same field for possible solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mistake#1: The wrong team</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes it happens that the travel company owners fail to build right kind of teams. You might have hired the wrong candidates for a particular positio. Becoming an entrepreneur is not going to be easy. First you need to gain knowledge about how to hire the right candidates for different positions at a travel company. Do not know anything about this? Don&rsquo;t worry and check the internet for help or consult a friend who might have worked in a travel company before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is going to be crucial to choose correct individuals with varying skill sets. However, the more attention you pay the higher will be your chances to get a team with reputable, skilled and hard working individuals. Their past experience in the same field will also be counted so try not to give any chance to a newcomer until or unless his education background is extraordinary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mistake#2: Bad pricing</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here again you can make mistake but remember to avoid it in any way. Providing the tour packages with bad pricing or at high costs is going to risk your repute. Calculate how much the customer is willing to spend on accomodation, on food, and on other stuff. Then you are to make a rough plan of what type of tour package to offer and adjust slight profit into it for your company. Do not put financial burden on the customers by offering them tour packages that are out of their investment limits. If you do so, then there are chances that you will loss them and they will never come back to your agency for any tourism-related help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mistake#3: Waiting for perfect too long</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you waiting for the perfect too long? If this is the situation then you are obviously doing a very big mistake. Whenever you get killer ideas, it is natural to work hard for turning them into reality. Let the world know about your creativity. Usually travel businessmen make mistakes of not planning the things properly, and they do not even come up with extraordinary ideas. This might be because they lack some creative skills or do not have enough thinking capabilities. Try to come up with the simplest, basic version of your services that can win many hearts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mistake#4: Not understanding technology</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have you developed some understanding of technology? No? Well you have to because without it none of your companies can be run smoothly. There are times when you have to develop company softwares, what are you going to do then? Instead of hiring some expert software developer in start, it will be better that you do such things yourself and that&rsquo;s only possible when you gain knowledge in the technology field. Also, you have to build a website/blog over which you can show the type of tour packages your travel agency is offering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mistake#5: Forgetting official documents</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a lot of people who, when starting businesses, forget completely that how important it is to get official documents. We highly recommend that you get your travel agency licensed. Also, you should keep the official documents safe. For this, you can hire an attorney or can keep them in a bank&rsquo;s locker. Sign contracts with the workers you hire, and all those documents should also be kept in locker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mistake#6: Being cheap about marketing</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>People want to know you. For every businessman, it is mandatory that he hires someone very expert for marketing work. Those who try to become cheap about marketing can lead their business at some risks. To do it properly and to target more and more local and international clients, the importance of effective marketing techniques cannot be ignored. Do not worry if the costs of this work are high. You cannot develop your travel agency without marketing. Use social media to build virality and attract customers for free. Run social media campaigns to get desired results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, we recommend to avoid these mistakes. Save your time, money and energy by taking wise decisions. Leverage everything you can and give yourself enough space to think out of box so that better ideas come out and you touch the peaks of success in business.</p>\r\n', ' mistakes, strating, travel, business, 6 Common Mistakes People Make When Starting a Travel Business', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5f3f7f152a30b.jpg', 4352, '2019-07-30 15:24:22'),

Most of the travel professionals serve at either private or government agencies, there are a few who are self-employed and are successfully running their own travel firms. Internet, no doubt, has made it easy for the average travel consultants to target the right kind of clients from all parts of the world. They, at the same time, should know and understand their responsibilities. Here we have given an overview of the duties of the travel consultants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Offering prominent and unique tour packages</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the core responsibility of the travel agents. They should work on designing the tour packages which attract more and more potential travelers in no time. Many people utilize travel consultants when it comes to book trips because these individuals are easy to approach. They (travel agents) should try their best to satisfy the needs of the clients. For regular or returning customers, there should be discount offers so that they should more and more interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Research</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the key reasons why travel agents are still in demand is the diligence they perform while they search the travel options. Those who are travelers don&rsquo;t like to give much time to find such deals on the internet. They are even not ready to select which destinations would be appropriate for their trips, leaving this duty on the travel agents. For a consultant with huge popularity, it is must to have insight look of what types of tourist destinations are the best for particular individuals, groups or newly married couples. On the basis of their research, they can then design and offer the travel deal to the client.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Budget-friendly deals</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes it happens that the customers demand something out of the world and at the same time they say that their budget is low. For professional and well versed travel agents, dealing with such clients is not so tough. Those who are new to this industry need to offer the tour packages which not only have variety but also are cost-friendly. In case there are clients demanding something very unique, the travel agent can design a package for them keeping in mind that the rates should be within the budget.. In addition to look up airfate or accomodation charges, the travel agents need to have insights of all items making sure that nothing goes out of the budget of their customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Book Trips</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the clients agree on an itinerary, the travel consultants make necessary arrangements so that the trip can be booked. The package might include airline tickets, hotel reservation, food, outdoor trips, and securing a rental car. Before booking, the agent should provide the clients with cancellation guidelines so that if they ask for refund, they know what policies are to take care of. This is what every travel agency representatives do because they work in professional environment and deal with loyal clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last but not the least the travel agents should collect payments in the way that suits them as well as their clients. They should not force their customers to pay the whole money in advance.

Researches suggest that there are particular genes responsible for the 15-20% of people to become &ldquo;highly sensitive&rdquo;. Certainly such individuals are in every field, in travel industry too. Below we have mentioned the traits of highly sensitive agents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Sensitivity and Emotional Intelligence</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emotional intelligence (EQ) is one of their core abilities. This is the name of recognizing and understanding the emotions of others, and creating awareness to manage the behavior and relationships. The good thing is the travel agents with this characteristic are better able to understand what their customers want. Their focus is much on providing the people with the desired services, because for them the satisfaction of customers is first priority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Experience the things more intensely</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sensitive people have ability to experience the things more intensely. As a travel agent, such an individual can easily identify the moods of the clients. This helps him to better communicate because he does not need words to know what is going on in their mind. The &lsquo;highly sensitive&rsquo; travel agents can even catch on to subtleties in gesture and tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>They think deeply</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are a person with high level of sensitivity then you can think deeply about the things.&nbsp;When life throws you a curveball, you begin retreating deep into the shell and think through all aspects to make things possible. This trait is even present in travel agents with &lsquo;high sensitivty&rsquo;. They get to know what type of services should be provided to the clients by digging deep the multiple things. They also can handle big issues and even help others to get out of the problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Detail-oriented</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are &lsquo;highly sensitive&rsquo; then there are chances that you become detail-oriented. You become sensitive to the feelings, felt and unfelt. In order to get rid of the mess, you evaluate the possibilities that could make you become successful in the professional life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Take longer to reach decisions</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking decisions is not so easy for those who are very sensitive. In case of travel agents, such individuals do not compromise on the quality of their services. They prefer quality over quantity, and are never ready to let the customers suffer. For this, they sometimes start offering a few tour packages but all are of excellent quality and high caliber.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>They are emotionally reactive</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When left to devices, the sensitive people have a knee-jerk reaction to the feelings. They are emotionally reactive. When the emotions are strong, they take any risk to get the destination of desire. The hard part is changing the feelings and producing the unwanted behavior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>They&nbsp;take criticism harshly</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your strong feelings and intense emotional reactions are able to make criticism tough to accept. For any &lsquo;highly sensitive&rsquo; person, it is next to impossible to welcome criticism. This might keep them away from getting improved. On the other hand, if they take criticism seriously and try to improve, then there are chances that they will achieve the desired results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What do you think about the above mentioned points?

Honestly speaking, nothing can beat the advantages of the home-based travel agency because here you don&rsquo;t need to invest any extra money and you can begin the business from the comfort of your house. But this does not mean the travel agencies with physical locations are not good to go with. In fact, many clients the world over give high preference to the travel companies with some physical locations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, we recommend that you begin an international travel agency and should forget about offering local tour packages which mostly customers will never ever go with.

For example, if you are preparing tour packages for the USA, Canada, and India, then you have to be familiar with the terms and conditions, as well as have to complete the paperwork of the target countries. On the other hand, those who are targeting European countries should remain aware of what types of terms are applied onto the tour operators. For better understanding you can hire a lawyer who will be dealing with all legal matters on your/your company&rsquo;s behalf and then you will have enough time to think about other things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Start a franchise</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is good if you start a franchise. Here again you are to follow business rules and have to take care of the regulations of the travel agency you are going to represent. At the same time, you should take care that the quality of tour offers is never compromised. For example, if you are to operate in Morocco, then you must locate which travel company has been in hire demand in this particular area. Based on your search, you should get in touch with the firm&rsquo;s representatives or officials and consult about the procedure to initiate. Whether you become an independent travel agent or are to resell the services, you are always to remember the taxes and have to pay them according to the foreign income rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Consult the trade groups</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is to bear in mind that the trade groups can guide you in a better way of how to begin with an international travel company. The best trade groups are Tourist Guide Associations, The U.S. Tour Operators Association and the National Tour Association. These provide help to stay on the top of industry trends by developing understanding of how to manage your company in the best possible way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By keeping in mind the above mentioned points, you can always stay at the top as an international travel businessman.

Well that is simply fantastic but you should not forget that any business needs lots of investment, marketing, and proper planning. You can certainly get a lot of ideas of how to begin and run a business successfully, but until or unless you have sufficient money you cannot run it smoothly for a lifetime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Why a business needs money</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, this is very interesting question that many of us ask. Why a business needs money? The simple answer is it has to defeat the other businesses and has to satisfy the requirements of the clients. You can consider the followings in this regard:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong><u>Licenses and permits</u></strong>.On the basis of the city or country you live in, you would have to complete special paperwork and have to register the business to get permit for its operation.</li>\r\n	<li>In order to run a travel business, you would require various things &ndash; which we call the &lsquo;supplies&rsquo;.</li>\r\n	<li>You would require specialized machinery or software.</li>\r\n	<li><strong><u>Office space.</u></strong>An office is obviously needed and this is going to be huge investment. You cannot ignore the significance of things like Internet and utilities costs.</li>\r\n	<li><strong><u>Associations, subscriptions, memberships</u></strong><strong><u>.</u></strong>&nbsp;You can get the travel agency registered and get its articles and relevant content published so that more and more members subscribe for your newsletters on a weekly or monthly basis.</li>\r\n	<li><strong><u>Legal fees.</u></strong>There would be times when you have to hire a lawyer to deal with some legal matters; for this you obviously need some money.</li>\r\n	<li><strong><u>Employees and contractors.</u></strong>You simply cannot run the travel agency without proper team. Paying them is mandatory and you have to give them salaries on the basis of their qualification and experience.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Now here there are some options you can start a travel business with almost no money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Option one: Reduce your needs</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first thing is you reduce your needs to much extent. For example, if you plan to begin the company where you will offer your services as independent contractor, then you can even run it with one or two co-workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Option two: Start a home based franchise</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a fantastic idea. You can start a home based franchise, which will eventually cut off the costs of your office. Instead of stepping out of the house on a daily basis, you are free to perform all travel-related tasks while living at your own pace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Option three: Outsource</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another option is that you start outsourcing the projects. For this, there are several marketplaces you can hire staff from. Outsourcing is in fact a great idea. This will lead you to have experienced workers and they sit just a click away because you are going to deal with all matters with your computer device connected to the Internet. As a result of this, you will cut off the costs which are likely to be a burden on you when you are to pay the in-house employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, how has been this post?

So, if you are looking to invest in the tourism business, you can choose from any of these niches and begin running the agency. The overview of the report provided by Xola says:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Tours with adventure tourism components run for about one week or two.</li>\r\n	<li>The people who take those trips age from 30 to 35, and belong to both genders: male and female.</li>\r\n	<li>About seventy percent of thrill-seekers focus on expanding their knowledge and they try to generate income more than the norm.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Zipline tours</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zipline-based tourism flies high nowadays. In accordance to the president of AdventureSmith and moderator of ZiplineNirvana, the Zipline tours are catching the attention of more and more people every week. Moreover, these are a way of transporting guests from one place to another. They thus have matchless experience. The costs of zipline tours are based on characteristics of topography and multiple variables, but these usually range from $200,000 to several million dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Trekking</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another exciting and fun filled niche of the travel business is Trekking.&nbsp;The Europeans have been much into this niche. They love long walks through urban lands and always love to explore wildlife. According to experts, more and more Americans have shown interest in trips to Utah, Arizona and Nevada. The director of Alpine Interface, a Canadian firm, has claimed that the trekking is like a blessing for those who love adventurous walks in far-flung locales such as Tibet. Starting up a trek is not going to be easy; it is because this requires you to be financially strong and you should also have great logistics. The cost per trek depends on the area you choose. It can be something arond $15,000 per participant or even more. Because of increased airfares and steeper price at the pumps, almost all Americans stay close to homes and they love to explore the beauty of their backyards only.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Horseback riding</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Horseback riding is one more very exciting niche of the travel business. You can offer packages to the customers related to this niche. According to the general manager of Los Angeles Horseback Riding, a company that offers trail rides into the Santa Monica Mountains, these days more and more people love location tour packages. The trend of not leaving the country has been increased just due to the reason that the economcal conditions of most of the people have been unstable. The trails are better landscaped, and rides at sunset have now become favorites of all people. Horseback riding is considered to be a way to get physical and mental relaxation. At the same time, its costs are never so high, so every person can afford to become a horseback rider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Specialty tours</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last but not the least is specialty tours.

Here we have shared the tips for increasing sales of the travel company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Highlight the benefits of your products/services</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is mandatory that you highlight the benefits of your products and services. In case you have a website, this can be done by showing the advantages of the tour deals and why they are better than the tour packages of other travel agencies. Here you have to convince the customers at any cost. On the other hand, if you have a physical location then you can highlight the benefits of your services through colorful charts, placed all over the office. This way, the customers will get instantly attracted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Engage yourself in social media</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The current era is of social media. No businessman can survive if he does not engage himself in social media. Whether you are an independent travel agent or have an agency with countless workers you are to keep the social media people engaged. This can be done with the help of pictures, videos, questions/answers sessions, and other formats. Learn the techniques of how to keep the followers engaged all the time. This way, you will be better able to know how to convince them for your tour packages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Offer added values</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try to offer added values. Do not place yourself in the list of travel agencies that all present same, ordinary tour packages. It is time for you to step forward and to think better. Come up with some creative ideas of how to offer some extraordinary values and how to convince the clients to be your successful, regular customers. Think of an observatory tour operator, who is offering private telescope viewing sessions. You must create your own, unique idea to engage the clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Find a travel niche</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We highly recommend that you specialize in one travel niche, and should focus less on the others. For example, you can establish your firm for offering the customers with mostly adventure tour deals. You can also specialize in certain demographic areas, type of travels, the major attraction of a particular country/city and so on. By finding a travel niche, you would be in the position to better focus on the best and unique deals. Do not mix all the things in one package otherwise your customers will never ever become your buyers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Extend your B2B network</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a very good idea to extend your B2B network. Develop relationship with business partners. Invite them to your office and visit them on regular basis. This way you will be able to learn multiple things from them, thus expanding your network. You will also get the chance to learn that how they are working and what type of changes you should bring in your travel firm.</p>\r\n', 'increase, sales, travel, company', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5d406ef836962.jpg', 3500, '2019-07-30 16:23:35');

More than fifty percent of the unsatisfied customers tell around 20 people about their unsuccessful tour deals. It is now your duty to make them happy and satisfy their needs fully. Here is how to deal with difficult customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Be patient</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be patient while dealing with customers who are difficult to understand. It is natural that they would talk a lot and would try to trap you in one way or the other. As a service provider, you have to satisfy them with friendly communication. Keep your thoughts positive and do not interrupt the unhappy clients. Try to understand their needs and make sure that you act accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Listen carefully</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Listen to them carefully and show sympathy about their unsuccessful past experiences with the travela gents.

Try to understand that they are humans too &ndash; they are just unhappy because of the poor treatment of previous travel company representatives.

It is highly recommended that you offer them different solutions of the same problem. Try your level best to convince them that while dealing with you they would not get any bad experience.

Remain polite as a travel agent because it is your duty to be presentable all the time. If you remain polite, this will show the customers that you have enough compassion. Polite behavior helps to avoid unproductive arguments!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Apologize if needed</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apologize if needed. Yes, you have to do it in case you have done some major or minor mistake. Try to understand that those customers are already unhappy and they just want your cooperation to get fully satisfied.

The workers, thus, need to be dealt with nicely. It is the duty of a company owner to keep the workers engaged in multiple projects. Also, he should not let them sit idol otherwise their performance will be affected.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n	<li><strong><u>Improperly defined goals of the project</u></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes the goals of a project are not defined properly.

If the goals are not defined clearly, how can one expect the workers to give their best!</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n	<li><strong><u>Poor research of travel software</u></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Without knowing what the travel software is about, you cannot get best out of it. Management strongly needs to invest time and money to find out the best solution of their business problems. In case of a travel company, it is highly recommended that the tour operator is being provided with a range of reliable and authentic software. Also, the management should be aware of the problems that arise during a project and they have to be prepared to welcome all types of challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n	<li><strong><u>Buying a system that doesn&rsquo;t work good</u></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Have you bought a system or two with poor performance?

These can never fit the requirements of a company so it is better that you don&rsquo;t waste your time and you should invest your money wisely on buying the systems that work as per the needs of tour operator so that he/she can give his best performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"5\">\r\n	<li><strong><u>Not involving employees</u></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Gone are the days when the employers used to hide all business matters from their employees.

Share your business ideas with them and allow them to realize their work responsibilities and organizational activities.

We, at the same time, need to boost online booking sales with travel product reviews. Do you want to know how to do it? Well, here we give you a brief overview!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Significance of Advertisement</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Advertising has always been important, but besides it you need to do other things too. For example, you are to accompany your ad campaigns with customer reviews. There are many travel websites on the internet that not only advertise their brand but also get maximum reviews. On the basis of these reviews, new clients can judge the effectiveness or non-effectiveness of a brand or independent travel agent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Building customer relations</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here we would like to make one thing clear that no customer will give good reviews about you until or unless you have built good relationship with them. Allow your customers to share their experience openely. Do not force them to only say good things about you because there are sometimes bad things too. On the basis of those reviews, work hard to improve the quality of your services so that more clients get attracted towards your travel-related deals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Increase your credibility</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Work on the strategies through which you can increase your credibility.

A website with no reviews will not get sufficient number of clients. As compared to this, a travel blog with many reviews will receive countless customer inquiries on a daily basis. Thus, you have the bright chance to boost your online booking sales by increasing the number of positive reviews.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Benefits of having online reviews</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here we would like to briefly describe the benefits of having online reviews:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>With it, you can target more and more clients every day.

They are likely to recommend you to their friends. Make sure you only have genuine reviews and whatever the previous customers have written should not be edited.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>With these things in mind, you can very easily make good money from the internet, no matter you operate from home or from an office.</p>\r\n', 'boost, onlinebooking, sales, reviews', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5d407308b3cf4.jpg', 2561, '2019-07-30 16:40:49'),

Mention their names/brand names on the social media profiles of your company. If possible, make a list of suppliers and upload it on your professional travel website. Put as many names of suppliers as possible so that customers get more attracted. In return, you should not expect any promotion since the suppliers are acting like backbone of your successful travel firm.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n	<li><strong><u>Meet in person</u></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>If possible, meet in person. Communicate with them in friendly way. Stop getting in touch with them only via emails, social media, or other internet based resources. Make time and visit the suppliers individually so that further discussions can be done regarding business. After this, you will see yourself that the business gets better because face to face meetings are always fruitful.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n	<li><strong><u>Follow your suppliers via social media</u></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>We highly recommend that you follow your suppliers through social media websites. These days, every one is online. We all spend much of our time surfing the internet and using social media networks. This is a golden opportunity for you.

Getting personal here does not mean you are to get involved in their family matters of their lifestyle. Here we mean to say that you pay attention to know about their personal data, contact information, events and holidays. It is always a pleasure to know about these things. For example, if you know the birthday of a supplier, you should wish him/her on the same day. It will definitely develop good relationship of both of you. Sometimes sending a Christmas card or buying chocolates for New Year or Easter is good idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"5\">\r\n	<li><strong><u>Treat your suppliers individually</u></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>All of the suppliers are different human beings with varying traits and qualities. You have to treat them individually. Make sure you know about the type of services every supplier is providing. On the basis of this information, you can evaluate their nature. Sometimes making calls to them is ideal. Regardless of the fact that you have so many suppliers, you still have to manage to treat them indivudally and in efficient way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end, I would like to say that the suppliers will start collaborating with you more once you remember the above tips for improving your cooperation.

In order to survive, you must own some qualities and distinctive properties that make you prominent from the others. Here we have given the list of traits of a successful travel agent. By developing these qualities in yourself, you can certainly get success and can make huge money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Dependable</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This trait will actually encompass a couple of human qualities such as being reliable, well-mannered and friendly. You have to let the world know how punctual and responsible you are. No matter what type of challenges you come across, your focus should always be in things which are purposed to be done accurately and correctly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Passionate</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be passionate about whatever you do. In order to become successful in the tourism industry, you have to show off your utmost passion and have to be enthusiastic about whatever you do. In the business world, not all things are easy to manage. There are tough times and there are easy times. In any of the period, you have to keep up the spirit, and should experiment with newer, unique things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Specializes</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being a travel agent is not so easy. It often gives you feelings of being like a jack of every trade. It is up to you if you want to choose an area of specialization. At the same time you need to have sufficient knowledge about almost all things of the tourism industry. This should not happen that you have specialized in one thing and do not know about the others. There are chances that customers will ask multiple questions from you, and it is your duty to be ready to give answers of all those questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Build Long Term Relationships</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think no one in the business sector can survive without building long term relationships. When it comes to become a travel agent, you need to stay in touch with the people of the same field. Clients, workers, and co-contractors &mdash; all are important and you can learn a lot from these people. You simply would not be able to serve the clients effectively if you just don&rsquo;t have any contacts and are trying to work alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Insightful to Customers&rsquo; Value</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be insightful to the value of the customers. This is one of the traits of a successful travel agent. Such a person knows the difference between any two things. He does not rely on the things that look charming from outside. He, instead, tries to find out the reasons behind their formulation and puts his efforts to know how those things are different. You can sell your services successfully only when you know the insights of the customer&rsquo;s values. Try your best to offer them something which is not made available by any other travel agent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Willing to Go the Extra Mile</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, you should be willing to go the extra mile. Without having such high level of motivation, you would never get success. Make sure that you are determined, and are ready to work hard.

If so then there are a couple of secrets you need to know for improving the quality of your travel blog. These are very easy and effective things yo remember.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Begin with development of the blog</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The very first thing is you develop the blog with good content published on it. For example, I run an adventure travel blog and that can be the idea you can go with. But remember there should be no copy/paste of the articles otherwise Google will ban your blog permanently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Learn from Professional Travel Bloggers</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is much to learn from professional travel bloggers. You need to unlock their secrets of success. They must be writing great quality content every day. Observe what type of theme they have used for their blog and you should use the similar one. Here again I am to tell you that you should not copy the ideas of others. Their travel blogs are only to get inspiration from. You can neither copy their content nor their theme or even the way they present their stuff to the audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Building An Audience Is Key!</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without building your audience, you cannot earn anything no matter how well developed your blog or website is. It is one of the key secrets to become a successful travel blogger. Build your audience; one of the easiest ways to do this is by targeting the people through social media networks. Facebook is the giant social network. You can create Facebook pages and run ad campaigns to catch the attention of more and more people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Create useful articles</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Write the keywords which the people search the most. On the basis of those keywords, you should create useful articles. Make sure that each piece you write is free from plagiarism and any grammatical error. In case someone noticed an error in your work, your website&rsquo;s image might be damaged. So, be very careful while crafting the articles. These should be created on regular basis. For the new travel bloggers, my recommendation is that they create at least four articles in a week, and the length of each should not be less than 1000 words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Guest Posting</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guest posting is an ideal way to get great organic traffic for your blog. You can find out which travel blogs accept guest posts. Contact their owners and submit your request of writing free guest posts with links back to your own blog. In this way, you can build quality links and target large audiences from all parts of the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>SEO is must</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only social media promotion but also SEO is must so that your blog survives for long in the competitive environment. Remember that there are countless travel blogs on the internet. In order to be visible in search engines, you would have to do strong SEO, but that has to be based on white-hat techniques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The above secrets, once remembered, can help you to achieve desired results.</p>\r\n', 'secrets, becoming, travel, blogger', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5d4076090474f.jpg', 2490, '2019-07-30 16:53:43'),

You have to develop contacts. In other words we can say that you should make strong PR (personal relations). Let me make it clear that without strong relations with business partners or professionals of the same field, you cannot simply enjoy all the benefits of the company in terms of profit. Develop network with others in the travel industry so that you can have nice relationship with the vendors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Is it mandatory to contact franchise owners?</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is tru that you have to know the contact numbers of the franchise vendors. This is especially a must-to-do thing for home based agents or independent contractors. Without getting in touch with the franchise owner, you cannot know what type of feedback you are receiving from the customers. You also gain enough experience in the travel industry by having relationships with the franchise representatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Should I take business courses?</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consider to take a couple of business courses so that you can learn about how to start and maintain the travel agency in an effective way. Finding these courses on the internet is very easy. Make sure the courses you choose are par your business requirements and those are enough to improve your learning and working capabilities. Participate in all paid and unpaid courses. You can even get enrolled in the diploma or certification programs offered by multiple universities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Is it good to join specific societies?</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For travel agents, joining societies and organizations is a good idea. These will be increasing your visibility as a service provider before the clients. This way it will be so much easy for you to get desired number of customers every month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Additional tips</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some additional tips are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Join the American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA), the National Association of Commissioned Travel Agents (NACTA), or the International Air Transport Association (IATA).</li>\r\n	<li>Become a certified travel agent instead of only focusing on gaining experience. With a certification, your knowledge is expanded, and you become fully professional.</li>\r\n	<li>You need to remember that it will take time to earn good profit. Be prepared financially till revenues exceed expenses.</li>\r\n	<li>Before starting the travel agency, make sure to research about your competitors. These can be present within your colony or even in the same city. You need to know about the type of services they are providing.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Last but not the least, we would like to say that you should become creative and should offer unique tour deals to your clients.

Doing better is one of the options you can go with in order to gain potential clients faster and quicker. The financial crisis and the increased competition among the businessmen have been the reasons why the customers do not rely on some brand so easily. They want to be assured that the agency or firm they are choosing will come up their actual expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In both large and small firms, there is always environment of competition. One has to pay utmost attention to all things in order to become a reputable businessman. Here we are going to discuss the tips startup travel agencies can go with in order to get success in short time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Correct business execution</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Correct business execution is always needed. You would have to see what type of services/ tour deals the customers look for. On the basis of this brief research, you can provide them with the needful. For example, if a tourist wants a package with affordable accomodation, food, and limos &ndash; then it is your duty to make that available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Work for positive feedback</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a businessman you can achieve success only when you work for positive feedback. Remember that doing so you can automatically generate handsome income for yourself. Work in the way that the customers get satisfied fully. Urge them to recommend you. This can also be done by offering special referral programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Be broad-minded and work for a broader roadmap in place</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is very easy for you to get lost in small and non-reliable interactive steps. Here you have to be broad minded and have to work for a broaded roadmap in place. What I mean to say is your should stop becoming happy with small and minor things when there are bigger and better options available. Learn how to get facilitated with those options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Start with low-hanging value propositions</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Start the travel agency or another with your low-hanging value propositions. This should be stopped when the users do not perceive value. Give importance to every worker and every client.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Manage your contacts carefully</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While running a travel company, you have to manage all contacts carefully. This is due to the reason that without managing the contacts, you cannot build reliable repute and cannot move on towards the peaks of success. In other words we can call it having strong PR (personal relations). Without that, the survival of your travel agency is simply not possible. I am sure you are putting in a lot and do not want to suffer from not being hired by any travelers. If that is the case then you must manage the contact lists and keep the information safe in your computer system, protected with a password.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Don&rsquo;t forget Licensing</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is very important to get licensed as a travel firm. Those who are running agencies without permission of the government are likely to suffer in near future. Here let me make this thing clear that when you don&rsquo;t work for licensing prior to settting up the firm, all your efforts will be failed because sooner or later your organization would be banned / closed permanantly.</p>\r\n', ' travelagency, startups, success, shorttime', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5d4162650e93d.jpg', 2031, '2019-07-31 09:42:09'),

I still feel that initially you should invest normal amount, which can range from a few hundred to several thousand American dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>There is no indicator</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is absolutely true that there is no specific and accurate indicator. You can even start for free if you are creative enough to attract the customers. On the internet especially at marketplaces there remains extreme competition. The more time you give to build up powerful profiles, the higher will be your chances to get hired by the global travelers.

You should immediately start getting quotes from them. Here I mean to say you should ask them about the tour packages they plan to offer, and how they can help you to achieve success in the agency. Once clear with this thing, you can then estimate the investment you need to do to take a start.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Consider to run a franchise</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you feel you don&rsquo;t have sufficient money to run a travel company, the ideal way is to become the owner of a franchise. Running franchises at home is very easy. Find out the travel companies on the internet that offer the chance to home-based travel consultants to work as their representatives or they might allow you to run their names&rsquo; franchises living at your own pace. In this case, you just need to give them so much success and lots of customers so they get fully satisfied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Why Agents Pay to Join A Host Agency</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are some situations when agents pay to join a host agency. Why it happens? This is because they are offered a platform to begin successful career. In return, they should either have years of experience or they should pay heavy amount to the host agency.

How much you get is dependent on a couple of factors; one of them is your previous experience and education background, and the second is how much determined and motivated you are to work as a successful home based travel agent. Beginners can even get 100% commission offers, in case their skills and working capacity is extraordinary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the above things in mind, you can certainly have clearer idea of how to start a home based travel agency and what would be its cost.</p>\r\n', 'startup, costs, home, travelagency', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5d41635965722.jpg', 2054, '2019-07-31 09:46:17'),

You certainly need a lot of things to take care of. There are a few ways to enter the tourism industry with aim to get success. If you love this industry, you need to keep in mind how to properly plan to have a bright, permanent career. Here is how to start an adventue travel company. An adventure travel agency is an ideal option because these days there are countless travelers who love to visit places, full of adventure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Understand the travel industry</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The very first thing is that you should understand the travel industry. Gain as much information as possible about air fairs, cruises, accomodation, best tourist destinations and others. Also, you should learn about the type of tour packages which are usually offered to the customers of this industry. Search the internet because it is the biggest source to get information. You can also visit local libraries where books of tourism might be available in large number.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Analyze your requirements</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have understood the basics of the adventure travel agency, the next step is to analyze your requirements. Remember that travel franchise businesses have multiple advantages. However, all franchisers require you to take care of certain policies. In case you don&rsquo;t want to own a franchise and have interest to build your own brand, you still have to be clear with what your requirements are and how you are going to operate so that you could come up the expectations of the customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Get licensed</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting license is very important. This is because without it, your travel agency would be considered as illegal. Actions are often taken from the government side against the agencies that operate without license. In order to save your repute from such a risk, you should obtain travel business licenses and permits from officials. Then you can run the business smoothly, without worrying of if this will be closed or banned. For this purpose, you can hire an attorney who can review all legal documents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Look for a suitable location</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have gotten the license, then you should start your search for a suitable location where the office has to be built. This location should be as per the rules and regulations of the government. At the same time, it should not be away from the approach of people. We highly recommend you to choose a location for office which is away from the hustle and bustle of the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Hire consultants and employees</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like all business ventures, for an adventure travel agency you have to hire accountants, business consultants, and other staff members. It is good to hire a personal secretary too who can perform all basic tasks on your behalf. The accountant will help you to manage the finance. On the other hand, travel consultants will offer excellent deals to the clients so that the business can be expanded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Develop marketing strategies</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any of the travel businesses or other type of companies, developing marketing strategies is very important. Without marketing, your organization can never ever grow. You need to do some marketing either yourself or you can hire a marketer for this task. Conduct comparison of mass marketing alternatives such as print, radio, and TV ads to target the right audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Find Proper payment methods</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next step is to find proper payment methods. You can accept money as cash, through cheques, PayPal, Payoneer, or credit cards. You should offer the customers with multiple payment options so that they can choose the one which suits them the most.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Follow franchisor guidelines</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try your best to follow the requirements and guidelines of the franchisor. Without it, you can never achieve the goals you always dreamt of. Remember to handle the customers with great care. Give them utmost importance and sell only what is authentic and genuine in terms of tour deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the above things in mind, you can not only setup a good adventure travel company but also can run it successfully years after years</p>\r\n', 'start, adventure, travel, company', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5d41645473c55.jpg', 2009, '2019-07-31 09:50:25'),

Your aim should be to win the situation, no matter how hard it is. There might be times when you will forget but doing so can lead you to suffer from damaged repute. In order to run any travel company or another type of business, keep on negotiating so that you get better opportunities to learn from the good or bad experiences of others. Take time to think that how yo convince the customers so that they not only become your returning clients but also recommend you again and again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Think long term</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try your best that you are taking the broaded views on multiple things. No matter how hard the work is to deal with, you have to commit yourself for long-term run. For this, first you have to be clear with your goals and target. The next turn is to work hard to achieve those goals. At the same time, do not forget to remain in touch with marketing persons and industry representatives. Again here you need to negotiate about the things that confuse you. Doing so can help you to improve the overall performance. In established domains like Management and IT, negotiation is considered to be the key to success. Without any doubt it is true that long term views would be paying dividends when measured against the whole life&rsquo;s relationship experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Get to know your customers</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Get to know your customers more and more. This is because without doing so you cannot build a good professional relationship with them. Here we want to say that knowing them is possible when you negotiate with them about the things you find to be challenging. Ask the questions from them and be friendly. Do not put any type of burden on their mind and let them speak freely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Avoid getting emotionally attached</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While running a travel agency, you sometimes get too attached with a customer or co-worker. Avoid this thing because if it so happnes you might you&rsquo;re your focus and would start thinking of other useless things. It is true that everyone has a rational side, an emotional side and varying behaviors, on the basis of which we can conduct self-evaluation. It is important that you stay connected with the office-based people only for professional reasons. Yes, you can negotiate with them about multiple things, but getting personal can lead you to suffer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Build and maintain trust</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without trust, there is no business. Just like other travel consulting company owners, you have to trade customer trust in your competence for money. As the part of the negotiating process, it is okay if you are presenting yourself as opportunistic, somewhat rude and serious-nature; but remember to never ever cross the limits otherwise the clients would no longer trust you and your services. Let me here make it clear that building trust might be easy but maintaining it requires a lot of time and dedication of lifetime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Be prepared for challenges</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While running a travel firm, you have to be prepared for challenges because they are going to be in large number. Not only physically but also mentally you have to be ready for some uncertain and sudden situations. It is up to you that how much stamina you have to deal with the bad times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keeping the above points in mind, the travel consutants and owners of other types of firms can understand that how important it is to negotiate the things. What do you feel about it?</p>\r\n', 'negotiation, consulting, firms', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5d4178a930eb1.jpg', 2076, '2019-07-31 11:17:04'),

Avoid plans to increase brand awareness, to increase sales, and to generate more referrals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Develop Buyer Personas</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here it is strongly needed that you develop buyer personas. Just like other travel agency owners, you are to find out the ways of how to develop strong buyer persona so that your goals can be achieved in a better way.

For this, you can develop a differentiable customer value preposition. Use the tools which are helpful for you in this regard. Use resources on the basis of your organizational resources. Be assured that the clients are being convinced more effectively because this is the only way you can stay in the market for long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Choose Best Marketing Platforms</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The selection of best and most appropriate marketing platforms is the need of the time. Some of the offline marketing activities include brand promotion, membership in consultancy association and others. This will give your firm a brand-new and excellent look. Make wise use of resources like web pages, landing pages, emails, social networking websites, blogs and others to let the world know about your travel agency. The most favorite mediums of marketers are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<table align=\"left\">\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td><strong>Platform</strong></td>\r\n			<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Percentage</strong></td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>LinkedIn</td>\r\n			<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;82%</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Twitter</td>\r\n			<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;81%</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Facebook</td>\r\n			<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;80%</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>YouTube</td>\r\n			<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;60%</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Google+</td>\r\n			<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;38%</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keeping the above in mind, you can choose the platform you trust the most.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Fix budget &amp; responsibility</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fix the budget of the organization as well as share responsibilities.

If you have just started working in the hospitality field then there is much you need to learn. For professional, hard working and dedicated travel agents, doors of opportunities never close. They just need to show utmost attention and have to stay motivated for surviving in this field. Here is how you can successfully work as travel agent.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Think out of box</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>It is definitely true that you have to think out of box. Getting education is not going to be enough because you need a lot more. Gain knowledge about most famous tourist attractions of the world, build your online profile on marketplaces, develop a professional website, and learn how to target the global travelers who might be interested in your services.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n	<li><strong>Understand the complexity of your job</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>In case you have desire to work for another company and do not want to setup own travel agency, you have to understand the complexity level of your job. Offer the clients with various travel options. If you are confused about how is it going to work, then we suggest you to check the internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n	<li><strong>Offer sufficient number of traveling options</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Do not forget that you are a travel agent and you are to satisfy all travel-related needs of the clients. For this, offer them sufficient number of traveling options. In order to do that effectively, online travel sites are what you can get inspiration from. These are great sources of information, and you can surely learn a lot from those sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n	<li><strong>Know the explosion of restrictions and hidden charges</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Bear in mind that it is your duty to unlock the door of knowledge for the customers. In order to do that work nicely you need to know the explosion of restrictions and hidden charges. Customers will definitely ask you about the costs of a particular package or more. So, while dealing with them, make sure you give them as much correct information as possible. Also, you have to not confuse them by offering multiple deals. Ask the client series of questions of what type of tour package they are interested in. This will greatly help you to evaluate their mind-set so that a relevant tour package can be offered.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"5\">\r\n	<li><strong>Which airlines are best?</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you know which airlines are best to work with? If no then as a travel agent you have to know a lot about this thing. There must be several popular airline firms in your country. What you have to do is to collect information about those companies and then you try to know which airlines offer the best packages as per the budget of your clients. On the basis of the information obtained, you can then sign a contract with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"6\">\r\n	<li><strong>Get connected with other travel agents</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Collaboration with other travel agents can give you chance to learn from their past experiences. So, we highly recommend that you get connected with them through online travel sites or other resources. Then you can develop friendship or professional relations with them, on the basis of you can better understand your travelers and offer them some tour packages more effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"7\">\r\n	<li><strong>Timely booking of flights</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>This is what most travel agents fail to pay attention to. Timely booking of flights for the clients is very important. Sometimes it happens that travel agents have charged their clients but forget to book their flight. As a result of this, the deals are cancelled and they not only have to refund in full but also they risk their repute.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"8\">\r\n	<li><strong>Provide complete contact details on visiting card</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>As a travel agent, you must have a visiting card. There would be times when the customers will ask for your contact details. In this situation, giving them a visiting card will leave good impression on their mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The above things are very common and easy to remember, but you are certainly going to face a couple of challenges if you are a newcomer in hospitality industry. Do not feel bad if things, initially, are not going well.</p>\r\n', 'successfully, work, travel, agent', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5d418a4c05419.jpg', 2035, '2019-07-31 12:32:21'),

To many of us, it sounds great to initiate as a home-based travel agents. A lot of people begin investing in the business too; but this requires your utmost attention and of course if you are newbie then your chances of growth will be nil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here I have tried to help you guide your own thinking and have given an overview of why you should not become a home-based travel agent.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t consider it a get-rich-quick scheme</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>If you think it is a get-rich-quick scheme then you are doing mistake. Those who are making huge income at home must have spent many years in this field. Can you tell me if you have that much stamina? In order to sell your travel work on the internet, you would have to work really hard. Remember that there is no shortcut to earn all those pennies which you see that others are making. Moreover, you have to stop comparing your earning with someone else. Some people will definitely make more than you; that is because they have devoted themselves to the online travel business. In case you don&rsquo;t have the same level of patience, you don&rsquo;t need to go ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n	<li><strong>It&rsquo;s a business</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep in mind that you should also consider it business, nothing very serious. There are always ups and downs in any business. Majority of online businesses fail and that&rsquo;s okay because it is a part of life. If you follow simple business tricks and remember the strategies then there will be fewer chances of you to not get success. Still I recommend to consider another business which is better than an online travel agency, because risks accompanied with it are always large in number.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n	<li><strong>It is a service business</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, that is true that an online travel agency is nothing more than a service business. There might be times when customers would not show any interest in your services. Whatever you sell on the internt does not always show good results. You are to sell what is the demand of the customers. If you have never worked in this field before then you must at least know the tricks of how to &ldquo;please the public&rdquo;. Try to come up the expectations of the clients in all ways. Believe me if you do so then your chances to get the services hired will tremendously increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n	<li><strong>Things go wrong</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>It is true that things never go as smoothly as you might expect them to be. There are chances that they will go wrong if your online travel agency is not initiated properly. In order to deal with this problem, you can think of the ideal tricks. Do not blame yourself for the things that have gone wrong. Believe me there will come a time when all the things are going to get absolutely right. If you are one of those who are very serious about home-based travel agency then my recommendation is that from very first point, your decisions should be wise.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"5\">\r\n	<li><strong>It involves selling</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>It is totally true that an online travel company involves nothing more than selling. The more glamorous your website looks the higher will be your chances to get hired. In order to make real money in this inudstry, you have to present attractive options to the clients, affordable deals, and must answer their questions. Not only this but also you have to deal with them in friendly and pleasant way so that their trust in you is built.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Above all, there is never any guarantee.

Here comes the answer!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About a Career as a Travel Consultant</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a travel consultant or travel agent, you get chance of combining your love for travel with one of most profitable careers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you become a travel consultant, you can start your own agency and get paid for every recommendation of vacation destination, secluded hotel, and luxurious cruise line from the valued customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only this but also you learn a lot about hot travel destinations, get exclusive access to discounted &ldquo;agent-only&rdquo; travel offers, as well as enjoy amazing deals and offers of traveling alone from the side of your travel company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Choose to Specialize</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like any other field, tourism industry is very vast. Either you have to run your own travel agency or are to do job at a public travel company you need to choose a specialization. Here I would like to say one thing that the famous travel agencies offer their consultants flexible hours and lucrative commissions for all successful projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Select to specialize in any of the following fields:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Adventure travel</li>\r\n	<li>Business travel</li>\r\n	<li>Cruises</li>\r\n	<li>Golf trips</li>\r\n	<li>Honeymoons</li>\r\n	<li>Eco-tourism</li>\r\n	<li>Luxury travel</li>\r\n	<li>Family travel</li>\r\n	<li>Spa getaways</li>\r\n	<li>Special lifestyles</li>\r\n	<li>Winery tours</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Get educated and learn new skills</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is true that a travel consutant does not need any special degree. But we recommend that you study hotel management or tourism related subjects in graduation and post-graduation. In case you have not studied any of them, you need not to worry, just learn the skills and get started.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Properly plan the travel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You need to learn how to properly plan the travel for customers. For this you must have answers of a couple of questions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>How travel industry works</li>\r\n	<li>How to do client consultations including provision of questions/answers sheets</li>\r\n	<li>How can I offer exclusive access to &ldquo;agent only&rdquo; discounts</li>\r\n	<li>How to advise the customers about all the things that range from cultural diversity to climatic changes in a particular area</li>\r\n	<li>How can I develop profitable professional relationship with suppliers of air travel, train travel, cruise lines, car rentals, hotels, and junior tour operators</li>\r\n	<li>Is any computer software needed that could help me in planning the travel</li>\r\n	<li>How to gain knowledge about visas, travel documents, and other official things</li>\r\n	<li>How to book the clients</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Getting Hired as a Travel Consultant</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have learnt basics of becoming travel consultant, the next step is to get hired by a reputable firm. For this, you can find travel consultant job openings in newspapers, on the job portal websites and social media networks. Track down unadvertised positions and keep on submitting your CV. Initially you may get no interview call but that does not mean you are to quit trying. Here I would like to mention that you need to develop strong job hunting skills within yourself. Sooner or later you will get an interview call. Prepare for the interview and if there is a written test, try to score maximum in that so that your chances of getting hired as a travel consultant are doubled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Start a Travel Agency or Travel Consulting Business</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you think you are not suitable to do job in any travel agency, then we highly recommend investing some money in your own travel agency or traveling consulting business. This gives you chance to work from your home because you just need to provide the customers with timely consutancy regardless of the fact that you are sitting in an office or at home. An ideal option is that you buy an existing travel agency, travel agency franchise or open a company with a whole-new brand name. Remember that if you own your brand then its promotion is going to take a lot of time and money-investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One more thing we would like to mention here is that you can partner with an established host agency or travel company. Create powerful business plan and share with the management of that company. Make them realize that why you are so important to their agency and how you can help them grow this company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next thing you need to remember is that the company name you choose for your own travel agency should neither be copied from another company nor it should be irrelevant.

There are a lot of things which you need to be aware of and which you need to learn. This post of today reflects some useful and essential lessons to learn before going into business with travely agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Select a Business Partner Wisely</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>It is mandatory that you select the business partner wisely. You need to check the internet for this cause and find out which private travel agency is operating for many years. Usually the companies that have mentioned their physical location, contact number, and date of operation clearly are the ones which you can go with. Those who hide all of such things could be fraud. So, you are to be very wise while choosing a business partner. Feel free to get in touch with popular travel companies or website owners and submit your business proposal to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n	<li><strong>Submit powerful business proposal / proposal of partnership</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>You must remember that no public or private travel agency or another company of any field will show interest until or unless you have submitted a highly impressive business proposal / proposal of partnership. Choose the format of this paper wisely and make sure it is impressive enough to keep you high in the eyes of business owners.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n	<li><strong>Evaluate the nature of your potential partner</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Evaluate if your potential partner has been a person with positive personality. If it is so then you are lucky because they would not put any pressure on you. On the other hand, the persons with somewhat rude and arrogant behavior can always give you big shocks. It is up to you that whom you work with and whom you reject to submit partnership proposals to.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n	<li><strong>Partnership should be 50:50</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>In case you have not invested anything, you reserve no right to ask the travel agency owner to offer you partnership with ratio of 50:50. Another case is that when the discussion between you two is about to final, you can offer to invest almost equal the amount of their total investment. In this situation, you can freely ask for partnership of 50:50, otherwise whatever they offer you in terms of share you would have to accept.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"5\">\r\n	<li><strong>Share responsibilities</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>It would be less stressful when you start sharing responsbilities as well as incoem. It is good if you take half of the burden and show off your dedication. Make them understand that you are very serious for the growth of this business.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"6\">\r\n	<li><strong>Choose what you want, not what is best</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, it is true that you have to choose what you want for your travel business, not what is best. Sometimes there come a lot of challenges. In order to deal with all of them, you are to go you&rsquo;re your mind and think of solutions yourself. Do not be one of them who fail to prioritize just because they like to follow the footsteps of successful persons in the same field.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"7\">\r\n	<li><strong>Do not be too greedy</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you see that the business has started growing, you can certainly have a word with the travel agency partner. But this does not mean you are given the permission to be greedy because in no business this works well. Show patience, maturity, and responsbility towards the business and stop being greedy. Money will surely roll-in to your pocket but doing things hurridly can lead you to suffer.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"8\">\r\n	<li><strong>Sometimes you must admit defeats</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>It is true that no one is perfect in doing all things. There would definitely be some things you are expert in and the rest are not good to with. In such a situation, we highly recommend that you admit your defeat. Give it your best shot &ndash; know what your heart and brain say and follow them. In case things do not go on smoothly then you have to admit that you cannot perform this particular task, and quit to move on towards something better.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"9\">\r\n	<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t take decisions suddenly</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Do not rush to take any decision. It will be hard in start to deal with multiple things in a business of partnership. But once you learn every small point, you will be better able to take wiser decisions. Whatever you do, do not take big decisions till you have understood all the things about the travel agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"10\">\r\n	<li><strong>Everything needs to be in writing</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>All the important stuff should be in written form. It is a better idea for you and your partner so that none of you forgets how the contract was formulated. Not only this but also you should record the major discussions and outcomes of the business. In case of any misunderstanding, you can refer back those pages and talk to each other to come up with a mutually beneficial decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is true that things in start may look difficult but they are not going to be once you keep in mind above points. These may look minor but are actually very important, and you will realize their significance once you step into the practical life!</p>\r\n', 'mistakes, starting, travel, business', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5d41979f0335a.jpg', 2167, '2019-07-31 13:29:18'),

You are to present them information about best tourist attractions.

If you have done with written test and are ready to nail the job interview at a travel agency, you need to keep in mind a couple of things. The very first I would describe briefly is that they should like your CV. Give it a highly impressive look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Job interviews are important but the people focus less on preparation. This can be your door that opens the world of endless opportunities, non-stop income generation and excellent career growth. Nothing guarantees that you will succeed but certainly there are a couple of things which can improve your chances to get hired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here we have briefly described how to nail the job interview of travel agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Preparations before the interview</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Preparations before the interview are very important. Be assured to do your homework as lack of preparation can reduce your chances to have the job. For preparation, you can remember following things:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Do your research: Do little research about the company you are going to work with. Find some information about its products, history, competitors, and market repute. Get information what the travel agency has gone through in recent years. If possible, find some reference of the same company.</li>\r\n	<li>Study the job specifications carefully: Have you studied the job specifications carefully? You need to know whom you are going to work with and what are your job responsibilities. Make notes about your past experience and education background, and get them matched with the job you are going to be interviewed for. This will give you clear idea of what the requirements of this job are and are you capable to fulfill them or not.</li>\r\n	<li>Think if you fit into the team of that travel agency or not: There are times when you have to convince others that you are the right fit for a particular job. Think if you fit into the team of the travel agency or not, and then move on towards appearing for interview. Be prepared to give examples so that they get satisfied with your self-confidence.</li>\r\n	<li>Prepare a set of questions you might like to ask from the employers: Do you have some questions in mind? Great! Prepare the set of questions so that you can ask them from the interviewer. Do not feel hesitation because this is your right so that you can develop better understanding of the job, pay-scale and company rules.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Common questions</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Certain questions are likely to come up your mind and you may have no time to enlist them at the spot. But do not worry because you can still ask those questions from the interviwer. The questions have to be clear, brief, and authentic. Some of the examples are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>What is the payscale?</li>\r\n	<li>How many hours I would have to work?</li>\r\n	<li>Do you like my CV and cover letter?</li>\r\n	<li>How would I have to handle constructive criticism?</li>\r\n	<li>What are your company&rsquo;s short and long-term goals?</li>\r\n	<li>What success rate are you expecting from the employees?</li>\r\n	<li>What problems workers come across and how you, as the company owner/representative, help them to resolve?</li>\r\n	<li>What types of motivating strategies you use for the workers so that they can give their best performance?</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Final Note</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>The final note is that you must make sure to get feedback from the interviewer of how your way of giving interview has been. Sometimes it happens that the employees need time to evaluate who could be the right candidate for a job. Let them have this time because it is their core right. During that waiting period, do not keep on calling them again and again to ask for status. If they are interested to hire you, they will certainly call you themselves. Allow them to take the right decision. Those who keep on asking the status updates sometimes suffer because this leads the employers to feel irritated, and they quit on you.</p>\r\n', 'nail, interview, travel, agency', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5d419c90da434.jpg', 2296, '2019-07-31 13:50:25'),

Running a business professionally requires a lot of attention, dedication and hard work. If you are lucky to setup a travel agency, then you can anytime check your laptop to find out a beach side hammock for spending the holidays at. Besides this, with a laptop you can reply emails without any worries of whether you are sitting in office or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Goals to set for a freedom business that allows traveling the world</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately there are not many businesses that allow you to travel the world openly, without any issues. Creation of a freedom-business that can provide financial security, location independence, and personal fulfillment is next to impossible. You definitely have to set some goals. A few of them, which are important ones, have been described here.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Great management of time</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>The very first thing you need to learn is great management of time. There would be a lot of things to do in business. It is up to you of how you manage your time for different things. Try to keep time for every big or small thing. Hire someone on your behalf for dealing with the customers&rsquo; inquiries.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n	<li><strong>Be clear with your goals</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Before you do anything else, it is very important that you are clear with your goals. You have to establish your business and get time for traveling the world &ndash; the two things are not going to be so easy. If you want to travel full-time or have wish of relocating, you need to be clear!</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n	<li><strong>Think bigger</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Always think and dream bigger than your expectations. Sometimes it is okay to be specific but this is not a good way to run businesses. If you have been putting ten hours a day in work, then the rest of time should be dedicated to sleeping, eating, and enjoyment. Besides this you are to think out of box and remember that no one is going to help you but You!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This step will assure that you spend the time heading in the right direction. On the road, I have met many people who put themselves in risky situations just with aim to achieve something bigger. Travel to Southeast Asia or Europe and see what the successful businessmen do to achieve success. With such a goal, it is truly possible for you to change the way and you can later on get sufficient time to walk through the streets of London or New York happily, with no financial worries.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n	<li><strong>Itemize Your Personal Assets</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>The next step is coldly taking of the personal assets. Prepare a list of them. This must include the things like money, clothes, shoes, and of course your laptop. The bright side of running an online travel agency is that you always have freedom to do business anywhere in the world because you just need a computer device to get in touch with co-workers and customers. If you ever come across something which is not yours during the travel, do not try to approach it.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"5\">\r\n	<li><strong>Build a Personal Business Plan</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have a list of personal assets, then comes the turn of figuring out how to utilize the best out of your time-investment. Keep in mind that there are going to be a lot of challenges in life. With a proper business plan, you can manage the stuff effectively. In case you do not feel that you are capable to setup a good business plan, do not worry and take help from a companion who is expert in this field.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"6\">\r\n	<li><strong>Do not travel fulltime</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, here I would like to say that you should not travel fulltime since you have a business to take care of. What I mean to say is that you can setup some time for the traveling and the rest of time should be invested in doing business. Remember that you need money to enjoy the luxuries of life and money of course comes from a reliable job or business. Those who plan to travel fulltime can risk their business and maybe they have to suffer later on. Do not put yourself in that bad situation!</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"7\">\r\n	<li><strong>Construct a Good Business Platform</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Having freedom of mind is only possible when you have constructed a very good business platform. For this, you can build a website or even just head over to social media websites. Create a profile on those networks and start selling your services. Before you receive some orders, you would have to wait because there is no short-cut to success.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"8\">\r\n	<li><strong>Improve Your Business Ideas</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have been going with the same, boring and odd business ideas then it is recommended that you change them. Improvement is always needed in any business. Have a strong network that is as valuable as the cash in your pocket. Promote your ventures through social media websites. Receive feedback from the clients and try to improve yourself. Keep in mind that there is no one who is perfect in this world. Everyone learns from others and there is always room for improvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end, I would like to say that it is up to you that how long you want to run your business. If your inputs are little then you might have to work hard for a lifetime. In case, you work really hard then there are bright chances that your current lifestyle will be improved in next few years, leading you to have enough time to travel through the world with friends and family.</p>\r\n', 'goals, freedom, business, traveling', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5d41a01f5afa4.jpg', 2049, '2019-07-31 14:05:42'),

You need to know what you actually deserve. Stop developing the stupid business plans which are good for nothing. Seek help from others who are in this industry for years, and have managed to become inspiration for everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n	<li><strong>Improve your ability to hoop adversity</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, you must raise adversity quotient. If you are really serious to survive in tourism business for long, then you have to accept the problems and hurdles with open arms. Startup companies obviously take longer to get recognized. If your brand is new, make sure to give yourself and your company some time so that more clients can recognize you. It will be your abilities to hoop that will determine whether you are going to succeed or will face disasters in a prolonged term.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n	<li><strong>Do not get disappointed</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes it happens that the things do not go as smoothly as we expect them to be. Throughout life, we make wrong decisions but that does not mean we should stop. In case the tourism business is not running as effectively as you thought, you should not get disappointed.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"5\">\r\n	<li><strong>Solving Bigger problems can be your biggest Rewards</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Solving bigger problems should not be an issue for you. The only thing you need is self-confidence. Too many entrepreneurs deposit time and income to formulate products with no marketplaces. It is just a part of doing experiments which you are also to do. Let me make it clear that by no means you should hesitate to take risks. The more you solve big issues the biggest will be your rewards in terms of successful business.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"6\">\r\n	<li><strong>Join a Mastermind</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Joining a mastermind is an excellent idea. You can either do friendship with a person with enough business-running capabilities or be a member of a group where masterminded businessmen are in no short. This group can be found anywhere &ndash; on Facebook, in a coffee shop or even at the nightclub. You just need to discover the persons related to your field and get inspiration from their business flourishing ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"7\">\r\n	<li><strong>Keep Workers Close to Yourself</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep the workers of the tourism company close to your hear. Never mind they are 100 in number or a lot more. You can keep a hold onto every employee if your behavior with them is cooperative. Do not be an &lsquo;Undercover Boss&rsquo;. Create as friendly environment in the company as possible. Leave chances of self-grooming for the employees. Last but not the least I would like to highly recommend that you should give bonus to workers on excellent performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"8\">\r\n	<li><strong>Practice Gratitude Daily</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Gratitude is one of the excellent approaches you can demeanour during life, so make it a permanent part of your personality. Set aside all the pride and rude behavior that has kept you isolated. Remember that no one, alone, can win the world. This clearly means you are strongly needed to practice gratitude if you are enough serious to move on in the tourism industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"9\">\r\n	<li><strong>Good Enough is Not always Good Enough</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>It is better to take movements on a daily basis. Do not consider that you have gotten everything because there is always a way or the other to move on. Those who think that they are good enough to do all the things are actually good for nothing.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"10\">\r\n	<li><strong>Best Ideas always come outside the office</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Your best ideas will come outside the office especially when you are running a travel agency. Whenever you face a problem, go out for a long walk, take a shower, or do something that entertains you. Allow your artistic skills to come out. These are the hidden, positive thoughts with which you can achieve success in every walk of life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Success in any business is not easy to achieve. With the above principles, you can certainly get improved. Make sure you do not cross any limit of doing business. Run the company as par the ethics and moral values so that you can get the desired goals as early as possible.</p>\r\n', 'key, principles, success, tourism', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5d41a14e63101.jpg', 2219, '2019-07-31 14:10:33'),

Running a business professionally requires a lot of attention, dedication and hard work. If you are lucky to setup a travel agency, then you can anytime check your laptop to find out a beach side hammock for spending the holidays at. Besides this, with a laptop you can reply emails without any worries of whether you are sitting in office or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Goals to set for a freedom business that allows traveling the world</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately there are not many businesses that allow you to travel the world openly, without any issues. Creation of a freedom-business that can provide financial security, location independence, and personal fulfillment is next to impossible. You definitely have to set some goals. A few of them, which are important ones, have been described here.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Great management of time</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>The very first thing you need to learn is great management of time. There would be a lot of things to do in business. It is up to you of how you manage your time for different things. Try to keep time for every big or small thing. Hire someone on your behalf for dealing with the customers&rsquo; inquiries.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n	<li><strong>Be clear with your goals</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Before you do anything else, it is very important that you are clear with your goals. You have to establish your business and get time for traveling the world &ndash; the two things are not going to be so easy. If you want to travel full-time or have wish of relocating, you need to be clear!</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n	<li><strong>Think bigger</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Always think and dream bigger than your expectations. Sometimes it is okay to be specific but this is not a good way to run businesses. If you have been putting ten hours a day in work, then the rest of time should be dedicated to sleeping, eating, and enjoyment. Besides this you are to think out of box and remember that no one is going to help you but You!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This step will assure that you spend the time heading in the right direction. On the road, I have met many people who put themselves in risky situations just with aim to achieve something bigger. Travel to Southeast Asia or Europe and see what the successful businessmen do to achieve success. With such a goal, it is truly possible for you to change the way and you can later on get sufficient time to walk through the streets of London or New York happily, with no financial worries.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n	<li><strong>Itemize Your Personal Assets</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>The next step is coldly taking of the personal assets. Prepare a list of them. This must include the things like money, clothes, shoes, and of course your laptop. The bright side of running an online travel agency is that you always have freedom to do business anywhere in the world because you just need a computer device to get in touch with co-workers and customers. If you ever come across something which is not yours during the travel, do not try to approach it.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"5\">\r\n	<li><strong>Build a Personal Business Plan</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have a list of personal assets, then comes the turn of figuring out how to utilize the best out of your time-investment. Keep in mind that there are going to be a lot of challenges in life. With a proper business plan, you can manage the stuff effectively. In case you do not feel that you are capable to setup a good business plan, do not worry and take help from a companion who is expert in this field.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"6\">\r\n	<li><strong>Do not travel fulltime</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, here I would like to say that you should not travel fulltime since you have a business to take care of. What I mean to say is that you can setup some time for the traveling and the rest of time should be invested in doing business. Remember that you need money to enjoy the luxuries of life and money of course comes from a reliable job or business. Those who plan to travel fulltime can risk their business and maybe they have to suffer later on. Do not put yourself in that bad situation!</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"7\">\r\n	<li><strong>Construct a Good Business Platform</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Having freedom of mind is only possible when you have constructed a very good business platform. For this, you can build a website or even just head over to social media websites. Create a profile on those networks and start selling your services. Before you receive some orders, you would have to wait because there is no short-cut to success.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"8\">\r\n	<li><strong>Improve Your Business Ideas</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have been going with the same, boring and odd business ideas then it is recommended that you change them. Improvement is always needed in any business. Have a strong network that is as valuable as the cash in your pocket. Promote your ventures through social media websites. Receive feedback from the clients and try to improve yourself. Keep in mind that there is no one who is perfect in this world. Everyone learns from others and there is always room for improvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end, I would like to say that it is up to you that how long you want to run your business. If your inputs are little then you might have to work hard for a lifetime. In case, you work really hard then there are bright chances that your current lifestyle will be improved in next few years, leading you to have enough time to travel through the world with friends and family.</p>\r\n', 'bestgoals, freedom, business, traveling', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5d41a38379598.jpg', 2693, '2019-07-31 14:19:56');

Stop doing a few side-jobs in your free time and think out of box. Starting an online travel business needs a bit of boost so that you can move towards the next level where success is waiting for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you are about to start the own travel agency or trying to invest in someone else&rsquo;, you need proper planning and management of things. These 10 tips on how to start and online travel business are surely going to be useful.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Understand your audience/customers</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a minor difference between audience and customers. You can surely turn your audience into successful customers by offering them something really amazing. There is no one who is always ready to start a travel agency without any risks. Business is just like that and you have to make your company prominent. Evaluate the risks that accompany with an online travel agency, and then find out the possible solutions. Keep in mind that most of online businesses don&rsquo;t get rolling till three years, so be mentally prepared to face that tough situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n	<li><strong>Get motivated to start a travel business</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Motivation is the key to a successful business. If you are planning t start a website, then inspiration comes from various sources. Understand what you want and be passionate about your travel business ideas. Turn your day-to-day struggles into a creative online travel agency the customers can rely upon.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n	<li><strong>Be persistent and dedicated</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Be persistent and dedicated. Most entrepreneurs do the same and you are to follow their foot-steps. Starting and operating an online travel business can be stressful, time-consuming and it requires more than enough hard work. After all these inputs if you achieve success then that will surely be the happiest time of your life.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n	<li><strong>Self-evaluation is must</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>You must invent your skill set. Honestly speaking this is one of the secrets of successful entrepreneurs. Self-evaluation is always needed, at any stage of a business. Check out Dribbble, Behance, Etsy, SmugMug etc. where professionals meet and discuss online business ideas. Do not forget to start a website/blog to let the world know about your brand. Without a website, you cannot be located by the potential clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"5\">\r\n	<li><strong>Define your online travel business</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>What does your travel business offer? Who are your clients and which deals make you different? You are to be familiar with the answer of these questions so that you can satisfy the needs of customers. Do not get tired while working long hours for peanuts. In order to deal with demanding customers, you are to present them something much better at your agency. Tell the audience what the name of your travel agency would be. Make sure you don&rsquo;t copy the name of others.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"6\">\r\n	<li><strong>Create a portfolio&nbsp;<em>before</em>&nbsp;starting an online travel agency</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>It is going to be too tough to start an online travel agency until you keep in mind each small thing. Create a portfolio before you begin the online company. For getting ideal clients you have to showcase what you are offering and what makes you different in tourism industry. Try to offer the services to local non-profit, government, or homeowner&rsquo;s associations. The hearts of people there can be won only when you have built digital and physical portfolios.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"7\">\r\n	<li><strong>Set prices of tour packages</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>On your official website, you have to set prices of tour packages. This will save time of your customers. It is an aspect many startup travel businessmen forget. Determine what you will charge for a particular tour package. Make sure the prices do not touch the sky, otherwise you are not going to get any customer. Determine how much profit you need for surviving in the business, find out what the market bears, and then set your packages&rsquo; rates. Give special offers to returning customers and create referral programs too.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"8\">\r\n	<li><strong>Expand the business through social media</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the business is somewhat established, then comes the turn of expanding it through social media website. Bear in mind that nowdays an online agency cannot survive until it has enough social media fans. You can run ad campaigns on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn like platforms. Use all social networking sites through which you can reach the target customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"9\">\r\n	<li><strong>Become a successful B2B businessman</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Like many others, you are to become a successful B2B businessman. For this, social media sites can help to validate the business. Whenever potential clients Google the business, they would love to find something more about your company.

It certainly requires much attention, proper investment, and great planning. In the competitive environment of today, it is really very tough to dominate the hearts of target customers until or unless proper measures are not taken.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your plan is to begin a travel agency, then you have to be aware of the bright and dark sides of this business. Spend sufficient time with newbies and seasoned veterans to get more and more inspiration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here I have put together the summary of the 10 mistakes one must avoid while starting a travel agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Not being different enough</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>In the tourism industry, there are many who work as travel agents and offer their services at cheaper costs. In order to gain success, it is important that you become different. Not being different enough can be risky for your travel agency. Provide the customers with variety of options to choose from. If the area you are operating in has many competitors, make sure the deals you offer are far better than theirs. Do not try to jump into the big things till you have sufficient experience. Also, do not expect to grow by offering inferior quality travel packages.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n	<li><strong>Choosing an area you don&rsquo;t know much about</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Have you chosen an area/city about which you don&rsquo;t have sufficient information? It is one of the biggest mistakes start-up travel agency owners make. You need deep knowledge of the subject, be creative, and should develop unwavering stamina. Besides this, you have to setup an office in the colony about which you are confident that the customers will get more and more attracted. Do not care of the competitors. When you are offering something nice, you will surely get flow of clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n	<li><strong>Starting with wrong expectations</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting with vastly wrong expectations is what many travel agents do. We highly recommend that you don&rsquo;t do anything to become successful. Remember that short-cuts are never a way to reach the heights of success. You have to work hard, develop new ideas, and think out of box. Too much expectation from a startup travel agency would lead you nowhere. Building a successful travel business is a massive undertaking. You would not be able to do that while traveling the world or while doing a fulltime job. So, spare some time for evolving better business ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n	<li><strong>Not accepting suggestions</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Talk to some successful entrepreneurs and travel agents of the town who have done something remarkable to achieve their goals. These people can be your inspiration. No matter if your travel agency is new or you are into business for years, until the traveling packages you offer are superb you will automatically get many clients in queue.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"5\">\r\n	<li><strong>Spending much time in thinking and doing nothing</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have been spending more than extra time in thinking and planning, and doing nothing then you are at the wrong track. Once you have decided your budget and planned the rest of things, then the next step is to take action. Your ratio of thinking-to-doing should not be less than 80%, otherwise you will suffer to loss many valued customers who might be looking for a travel agency around.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"6\">\r\n	<li><strong>Planning everything alone</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Those who think that they can get their aims alone are doing wrong to themselves. We cannot neglect the fact that a travel agency includes a lot of people who are to work together as a team so that they can make it a brand customers would rely on. Planning and trying to do everything alone would lead you nowhere. You have to take help of other professionals of this field at every step if you are really serious to get the target in short time. Keep in mind that you need people to make the travely agency work effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"7\">\r\n	<li><strong>Waiting too long to launch the agency</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>When you start developing plans, it&rsquo;s easy to get stuck on a lot of things. But this does not mean you are free to wait too long to launch the agency. Do not be one of those who keep on waiting for magics and waste much precious time. Also, you should not act like those who talk to themselves about developing a successful travel agency but are afraid to take risks.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"8\">\r\n	<li><strong>Not solving unimportant problems</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>During the running of a business, everyone has to be ready to solve both important and unimportant problems so that the work goes on smoothly. Have you ever tried to be one of them? Travel agencies fail at times when the owners do not solve the minor problems. In such a situation, if you will put your services out there no customer will show any interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"9\">\r\n	<li><strong>Not paying attention to complaints</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Listen to your customers and try to resolve their complaints timely. Providing validation to them should be one of your core duties. Listen to everyone and then act as per the policies of your agencies. You cannot pay lip services to the tourists. Without them, your company is nothing so resolving their issues is your duty.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"10\">\r\n	<li><strong>Using repeated ideas</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you using repeated business ideas? If it is the case, then let me tell you that your business would not run so long. A travel agency should be an incredible place where tourists can come and get ideas of best destinations of the world. Connect with more and more audience through social media websites and let the world know about your existance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s so easy to get worried about the mistakes, but dealing with them and resolving all issues should be your mission. You have to make sure that you have taken guts and intelligence to deal with variety of customers of this industry. One of the best ways to ensure that your travel agency would succeed you have to take risks of all types that guarantee that your travel agency would become a full-fledge brand.</p>\r\n', '10mistakes, avoid, starting, travelagency', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5d4ea09e508f3.jpg', 4817, '2019-07-31 14:27:07'),

So the only option left to work with such companies is the white-labeling solution.</li>\r\n	<li>&ndash; You have 100% access to the codes of your application</li>\r\n	<li>&ndash; You must have a technical team, who has the knowledge of how API works and their terms and conditions of API usage.

The competition in market is tough for each business and whoever provides the best wins! </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Traveling is not just a piece of cake and maybe that is why there are travel agents and operators to make the trips successful for the travelers. If traveling was only choosing a destination, booking a plane ticket and flying out to it then it would have been really easy for any common person to do it all by themselves successfully but they come to travel agents for <strong><em>&ldquo;something&rdquo;</em></strong> and that is a <strong><em>nicely formatted holiday plan/itinerary</em></strong> that helps them have a successful trip in a relaxed manner without any major hitches.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Tourism is no doubt a very customer oriented business. Formatted itineraries for the customers is not a very easy thing to do. It needs deep research and a certain level of knowledge before writing a well informed itinerary. It is tricky business as well because you have to keep a balance of seeing enough, without trying to see too much. Itinerary development is a powerful tool in organizing information about an area&rsquo;s attractions and presenting that information to visitors in an appealing manner.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Representation of itinerary to the clients:</span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">An itinerary is a day to day plan of a journey. The more comprehensive your itinerary is, the more it demonstrates your professionalism to the clients. From your logo to agency name to contact information to supplier details to passport and visa information and all other details and information that the clients needs to know should be added to the itinerary so that your clients can use the itinerary as their main travel document. While working on the tour/vacation of your clients you will receive &mdash; via mail, email, fax, or over the phone &mdash; confirmations from the suppliers for each of the&nbsp;elements that have been confirmed. All the valuable information should be added up to the final travel document/itinerary for your clients.

In your itinerary add neatly presented services, hotel stays and facilities, meal plans, along with other information in accurate costing so the clients can compare given quotation with others and chose easily. Remember one thing, no matter how better your holiday package must be both is cost and services vise but if you&nbsp; fail to convey it to your clients in simple clear words through your itinerary then certainly DO NOT assume they will opt for your holiday plan since they weren&rsquo;t sure as you didn&rsquo;t come clear.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Secondly, the key to win is to add some more value to your plan than competitors.

(55, 1, 'Sales tips for abundant flow of clients', 'sales-tips-for-abundant-flow-of-clients', '<p>Every business has one or two basic things that are like oxygen to its living and survival, just like that SALES are oxygen to the business of travel agents. All travel agents want to rock with their sales. The travel industry has become very fast paced and diverse in the recent few years with new travel agencies&rsquo; popping up every few weeks. Same is the proportion of the dead ones because mostly when travel agency managers constantly just focus on increasing sales, keeping it their prime focus and fighting for their share of customers, they somehow forget what they are doing it for, the quality of services and coming up with all that they commit to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;The anxiety of SALES for the travel agents is real but here you can put your anxieties aside by having our TIPS for sales and rock you own sales very easily!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Remember! It is about your customers not you:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being a travel agent your focus should be on fulfilling the dreams of your customers not your own &ndash; by providing your customers with what they want. You should not be thinking as per your own wallet, offer private transfers, ocean-view rooms or an amazing premium cruise line because for you it might be pricey or not worth this much money but probably that is what your customer is looking for. Customer satisfaction is that factor with which any travel agency can pump up its sales. For the satisfaction of its customers, travel agents should regularly demonstrate to its customers &ldquo;how important they are&rdquo;. For this purpose many agencies hold certain annual events, like grand dinner, appreciation open house etc, with talks cherishing the travel memories and small thoughtful gifts. The key is to stick to this reminder &ldquo;The trip belongs to the client; don&rsquo;t limit it to your own ideas and your own budget&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Find your niche &ndash; Focus on your niche:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Travel niche means to be specialized in certain demographic area. By finding your niche it means to be very clear about what you are selling. You should never try to sell anything that you are not very sure about. So before selling anything you need to do proper research, know the products you sell inside out and then decide on what destinations and products you are selling. For example, if you are expert at holiday plans &ndash; stick to it &ndash; that is your niche &ndash; don&rsquo;t try destination wedding with new client. One single travel agency can not offer everything. Every successful travel agency is limited to certain niches. &ldquo;We do not sell travel. We sell our knowledge, experience, and service; and we then provide travel,&rdquo; said Geoff Millar at Ultimate All Inclusive Travel Inc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to be a successful travel company it is important to develop your business in a specific niche market. The more unique your travel niche is, the more better. &ldquo;Sell what you know and stay away from what you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Lindsay Foerster of Foerster Travel Inc.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Diverse Audience &ndash; Diverse approaches:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generational differences in your customers will dictate you to have different types of strategies. One strategy that works well with one customer may not be fit for many others. So you need to act and respond accordingly. For Example; you can not just limit your correspondence with your customers to emails, because there might be some age groups who are not much into technology or maybe don&rsquo;t even know how to check emails. Such differences will dictate you which sales approach works best for any given situation. Thus focusing on target audience is more important than focusing on the type of travel. One good example to understand this concept is that; selling a certain tour or destination to honeymooners is handled differently than selling the same tour or destination to an elderly or retired couple, one common strategy can not be used for both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of your potential clients might feel technologically intimidated and the idea of dependence on technology in many things might not suit them. So you must come up with ways to satisfy them. In travel and tourism the customers always expects promptness in your replies to their queries because they are mostly in excitement of bookings their holidays etc so if you fail to reply in time, there are greater chances they will move to the next available options and you loose one potential customer. Who would want that &ndash; NO ONE!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Excessive information flow &ndash; NOT recommended:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your customers should be excited for the trip they are buying from you, you are their cheerleader. It is very tricky as to how much information should be provided, as there is very fine line between the right amount of information and overflow of information. Right number of options and correct limit of information will overwhelm them but certainly overload and abundance of information might confuse them or bore them. It is &ldquo;know &ndash; yet &ndash; don&rsquo;t know situation&rdquo;. You should provide just enough information to wet the client&rsquo;s appetite and then they want to discover it themselves. Don&rsquo;t shower them with everything you know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abundance of information may give the vibe that you don&#39;t know what your client wants exactly. By dumping a huge load of options on your client, you will stress them out and that is not what they came for to a travel agent. So the tip is to know your clients, know about their requirements and then on the basis of that create a few strong choices rather than a bunch of questionable ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Selling Experience, Not A Product:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember you are your own billboard and your experience speaks for you more than anything. On social media you can post pictures, videos, etc about your travel journey and share the experience with your followers and friends, the more attractive your posts are from your travel experience, the greater are the chances to captivate audience who wants to experience the same. That is how you can close a sale with your experience and that is how many successful travel agencies are doing it. Most of them have hired a professional social media manager who can keep their profile updated with content from their trip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Add the personal touch:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Always add a personal touch to your services to stand out from the rest and close a sale with new clients, thus increasing the revenues. Never be afraid to go out and be loud with your services and make it personal by offering something unique that no one is offering in the market. Remember most of the clients do not come to you for cheap rates; they come for wow-worthy experience and something exceptional in peerless comfort and unique style. Your clients need someone who can help them make good decisions not the least expensive options. Keep updating your services as per the market trends. Your aim should be to make each and every trip of your clients an amazing lifetime experience &ndash; something great to be remembered with!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;Last but not the least &ldquo;Think bigger&rdquo;.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With these amazing tips any travel agent can UP the game of its sales - have abundant flow of clients, close more sales and make <strong>2019 most lucrative year!</strong></p>\r\n', 'travel agency sales, sale tickets online, free hotels booking, flights and hotels last minute', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5d65555cadeca.jpg', 2615, '2019-08-27 15:38:20');

With many travel businesses doing too good there are still always few who perform much better than the rest. We should always have eye on the top performers in our industry and see what they are doing so you can figure out what you are lacking as a business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Below is the list based on ideas about all the things that successful travel agents are doing around you &ndash; what every travel agent can do &ndash; what every travel agent should do &ndash; in order to adapt to the challenging environment and thrive in today&rsquo;s environment where the travelers are so aware and very demanding with what they want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A personal touch:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the market don&rsquo;t be just another travel agent but differentiate yourself from the rest. Give your customers highly personalized services and recommendations etc just so that they get the special feel. Right from your first interaction with them whether it is on phone, over an email or in person just give that &ldquo;you are special and exclusive feel&rdquo;. More than that &ldquo;be available&rdquo; to your clients. When people are planning a trip they just want to have this surety that they have someone they can contact in case of questions or if any issue arises. Your connectivity with your clients is really important anytime and anywhere you are. If you are travelling, your phone should have roaming. Your response to new queries as well as to the queries of current clients should be prompt. Improving communication skills, especially writing skills can improve the quality of the experience an agent can deliver to a client. Give your clients the confidence that their needs will be handled adequately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Have smart presence on social media:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Social media presence, on various platforms is highly recommended. Not merely the presence but also using it efficiently. Your clients can be your immediate fans and followers. You should not hesitate to ask them to leave a review on your page. Review section is really important because nowadays people straight away go and check it out before trying out any service. Have interactive posts so that your clients and fans feel the connection with you. Engage them with insights and tips. Here is a smart for facebook pages, facebook pages are best used when they are more for engaging with clients/fans, instead of selling platform. On your page be helpful for your clients/fans with your knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Constant research:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>People who contact travel agents expect from them to know all. It is not merely booking up a flight or doing reservations and simply flying out. There is so much more to that. Clients want to get information from you about anything to everything. They expect from you to offer them something different in a very common destination or maybe a very unique destination. To gear up with all this a travel agent must conduct extensive research on different travel destinations. A successful travel agent is the one who has information on variety of destinations that are unique to people. That means that travel agents provide details of the places where clients want to go immediately to allow them to make informed travel decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mobility:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As per current market trends sitting behind same boring office desk and telling your clients about life adventures or exotice places looks so boring and less appealing. It is 21st century and by being mobile you can do more in more spaces, why to confine yourself to four walls. If your client wants to eat you at some caf&eacute; or coffee shop and discuss travel plans over there, then why not! There is no harm in it since you have internet availability everywhere,, you can do all the booking through your Smartphone or tablet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This flexibility in your style of work makes your life easier as a travel agent. You are not limited to any business hours, you can work with them at hours that suit both of you, if they can&rsquo;t get to your office address because of any reason you can get to meet them at any location that is easy in access to them. This willingness to flexibility is something that defines future of successful travel agents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Be technologically equipped:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Technology is the basic tool that helps travel agents to become successful by managing everything efficiently. So it is something that you being a travel agent should not over look. With good travel based software you can do so much of your work in just a click. For example: booking up flights, signing contracts, sending many requests together &ndash; all this and much more in just a click. Good software can also help you with your cost effective planning by doing al the research for you and offering you things in best rates and offers. Some software&rsquo;s can even offer you to analyze market demand and supplier pricing, hence allowing you to identify the best location, dates and suppliers for your next group tour or event.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Think out of the box:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be a successful travel agent you must not limit your thought process and function in certain set robotic manner. To stay in the limelight and win the hearts of current as well as new clients you have to think out of the box. The travel industry has changed tremendously over very short period of time and its still accelerating at same pace. You should focus on your potential clients and what they are looking for. For example you will be surprised to see how much of the time your potential client is spending online searching and researching about a destination wedding forum or best gateway for a bachelorette party. Do a deep research into various avenues where potential clients can be found and see who you can serve best with your available options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Choose the best options - follow them and take steps towards great success in your continued business endeavors.</strong></p>\r\n', 'successful travel agents, successful travel agency, how to start online travel agency', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5f7f244421428.jpg', 3279, '2019-09-11 07:00:47'),

The lack of technological support hinders success by limiting the growth options, creating more errors, wasting lot of energy and time. Incorporating Travel CRM software into travel business allows companies to deliver differentiated services to the clients. CRM software is an innovative technology platform that serves either for efficient collection and sharing client information or automation of most important daily job activities thus brining ease.

Difficulty in understanding and implementation of CRM software will ultimately lead in demotivation of the sales and operations staff to use it. From screen design to the interface everything needs to be user friendly and self understood. Automation of work will save many hours of the employees, making them stress free and improving the overall quality of work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>It should be Affordable:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cost and benefit analysis should always be done before purchasing the CRM software for your company.

In the crowded market of travel and tourism there are a lot of service providers and online travel portals so one needs a proper research and background in formation before the purchase of the software. The provider should offer you free trial of the software so you can get comfortable with it and see what exactly is being offered before making the purchase. Instead of doing one big investment of CRM software, it is recommended for the travel agents to go for the less priced subscription based travel CRM. Smaller price puts travel agents in less risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Key Point:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The travel CRM software that you purchase should not be limited to one or certain specific number of users rather multiple number of users should be allowed to operate the account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Accessible from anywhere and anytime:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is very important that your CRM software is available anywhere, anytime and you can get access to it. In today&rsquo;s world the travel business is connected to the internet every time and all day to day processes from bookings to reservations etc are done online.

This strategy makes you win many customers specially those who are planning travels in certain budget and have limitations. Whenever they will have a need they will contact you.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Offer something unique:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You travel plans should be better than the big players. They should have better design, impressive itinerary and have some free goodies. Such exclusive things will help you stand out in the market. While offering exclusivity and better design, you should not compromise on your margin, which is already kept very low being a new travel agent. Whenever customers are looking for a travel plan they always get hands on multiple travel plans from various travel agents and then they compare them before deciding one. So your research on plan and its design is really important. On the basis of your travel plan design you are being judged &ndash; it needs to be amazing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Find your niche:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Travel niche means to be specialized in certain demographic area. By finding your niche it means to be very clear about what you are selling. You should never try to sell anything that you are not very sure about. So before selling anything you need to do proper research, know the products you sell inside out and then decide on what destinations and products you are selling. For example, if you want to excel at holiday plans &ndash; stick to it &ndash; that is your niche &ndash; don&rsquo;t try destination wedding with new client. One single travel agency can not offer everything. Every successful travel agency is limited to certain niches. &ldquo;We do not sell travel. We sell our knowledge, experience, and service; and we then provide travel,&rdquo; said Geoff Millar at Ultimate All Inclusive Travel Inc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to be a successful travel company it is important to develop your business in a specific niche market. The more unique your travel niche is, the more better. &ldquo;Sell what you know and stay away from what you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Lindsay Foerster of Foerster Travel Inc.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of offering services for several destinations, you should focus on a few destinations only. Over the time you will become specialist on your niche and will develop your strong network on those destinations. If you do this Soon you will be drawing buyers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Follow these strategies and go win the travel markets!</strong></p>\r\n', 'startup travel agency, online travel agency, how to start travel agency, opening travel agency.', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5d8b4b8c1dc43.jpg', 2499, '2019-09-25 11:11:09'),

There is always room for betterment in the services you provide to your clients and there are always ways, means and times by which anyone can deliver even better to the clients. All it needs is dedication and focus. Ultimately, what speaks for any business is its quality of services to its travelers<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The best marketing!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Good customer services are not just limited to doing right to your customers and just giving them the required services and then not checking on them, that is not how your travel agency will grow. If you want your travel company to grow, you need to assist your travelers and clients with assistance for all their travel and travel software related needs. This ultimately will help your business grow into a trusted brand that others will definitely flock to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let us help all you travel agents with things you need to do in order to bring betterment in customer service:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Focus &ndash; Be an expert:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For any travel agency to improve its customer quality service &ldquo;focus&rdquo; is the key factor. Focus on your niche and be an expert at it. Working as travel agent doesn&rsquo;t merely mean booking up flights for your customers from on destination to other. This is not what travelers want from travel agents because these small things they can do themselves. If someone comes to a travel agent he or she wants something much more complex and being an active travel agent you must be ready to deliver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A successful travel agent needs to be specialized in his services, knowing all the ins and outs that are much more difficult to come by as a member of the general public. Being an expert in your area means that you specialize in your given area or region making yourself an expert about how to navigate, interact with, and know special little things in those areas that can make a normal trip something special and adventurous.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To stand out from rest of travel agents in your offerings for your travelers offer something that sets their trip apart. Part of this also means crafting special and unique experiences for the unique individuals who come to you. Learning how to specialize and&nbsp;spot those little life-changing add-ons&nbsp;can help foster goodwill, build trust, and bring your customer relations to the next level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Built the confidence:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once your clients or potential clients trust your words it means have won them. Therefore investing in gaining their trust is really important for any travel agent. If your client has got trust issues on you then it really does not matter how low rates you are offering them or how high rates you are offering, what great deals you have, how much competitive you are in the market or how much you know about your area. In travel industry trust is the foundation for every sale and for every marketable adventure, and a very simple fact is the more your clients trust that you actually have their goodwill and best interest at heart, the more options, packages, and add-ons you will be able to sell them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be genuine and honest in everything you do and offer, in order to sell more and more importantly give them an amazing experience for all the trust they have in you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sell your Expertise:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a travel agent his expertise is his asset &ndash; USE it &ndash; SELL it. It has become harder for travel agents to offer better deals than individuals can find over the internet themselves. This is because of the online booking system, tools and airline offers. The things have become tougher for travel agents to attract clients. In such a situation the best thing any travel agent can do is to sell his Expertise rather than selling what is easily assessable in the market. Sell what the potential clients can not buy themselves and they are forced to come to you. This means you are selling a specialized, customized, unique experience to your clients. The more special and unique you can make it, the more satisfied your customers will be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Be Active &ndash; Be available:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being a smart travel agent or travel software service provider the best thing you can do is to be available for your clients and listen to their needs. That is one integral part of good customer service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quick response time is a must. The hallmark of excellent customer service is the ability to actually reach to your clients. In today&rsquo;s world with fast technology, social media, cell phones and internet it has become very easy. It only works if you are willing yourself to be available to your clients whenever they need you and your assistance. For example; if your clients are traveling abroad and something were to go wrong, they need to be able to reach you any time of the day or night. Remember, they have spent lots of their hard-earned money and time trusting that you will provide an excellent trip and excellent service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your clients are facing some problem and instead of being available to them you are just hiding around that means you are not going to see those clients again. We all know how annoying it is when you are put up on hold and a ten minutes wait become hours long wait when you desperately in need to holdon to someone when you are in trouble.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is why solutions like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://phptravels.com/\">PHPTRAVELS</a>&nbsp;are there for travel agents to gear up with all the needs of a travel industry and push their growth and uplift their success rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So be a smart travel agent and learn to offer the best customer services you can, gear up your systems, shift from manual systems and upgrade to software technologies thus keeping lifetime clients. In no time you will become a travel agent known for exceptional customer service.</strong></p>\r\n', 'travel agents software, quality of services, the very first thing for travel agents, starting a quality travel service', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5da0f48b027a9.jpg', 2066, '2019-10-11 21:28:14'),

Do you need an overview of how to start in the travel industry?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Travel and tourism is a lucrative business all around the world. Average income from commissions adds up to a handsome amount. People around the world travel for multiple reasons, and in many different ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some travel for business, some for vacations, others go for a honeymoon, many travels for religious reasons.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A newbie or an aspiring travel agent usually has a lot of questions in mind.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Related</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://phptravels.com/blog/10-mistakes-avoid-starting-travel-agency\">10 Mistakes to Avoid While Starting a Travel Agency</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such as, what are the prerequisites to becoming a travel agent?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What makes you eligible to be a travel agent?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are the key responsibilities of travel agents?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How to gain or develop all the skills needed?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keeping this era in mind, let&rsquo;s talk about how to be a travel agent. This will get you mentally prepared and, hopefully, set you on the right track.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. Key Responsibilities</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1573889662/Key_qa2pz8.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>First and foremost, one should know what travel agents actually do. Knowing what travel agents are responsible for will give you insights on what needs to be done in order to become one. Here&rsquo;s a list of key responsibilities of a travel agent.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Marketing and Promotion</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This would be the first step to implementing your plan. Whatever your goal may be in terms of sales, it can&rsquo;t be achieved without marketing and promotion. Without marketing, no one will know you are a travel agent who has a variety of packages to offer. They won&rsquo;t know what it&#39;s worth until you tell them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marketing and promotion are how you communicate with a broader audience. In this day and age, marketing has become way more comfortable with all the digital resources. With an increase in resources, competition has increased too. Therefore, learning to utilize these resources to the optimum is vital.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Customer Service</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you are past the awareness and interest stage in your marketing strategy, there can be tons of people calling, messaging, and emailing you.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They will have all sorts of questions like what you have to offer, where to travel, what&rsquo;s best for their budget, what&rsquo;s included in your packages, general information and so on.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You will have to maintain your composure, give them all the answers, and compel them to buy your services to the best of your abilities. This requires training and practice in customer service. You might have to set up and manage a whole team for that at some point.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Helping through the Application process</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>You will be dealing with people having all sorts of backgrounds. Some might be illiterate. Some can be literate but not well aware of the systems. And many might be really educated and well versed with the whole process.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There can be others who might be well aware of the procedure, but too lazy or occupied to do everything by themselves. You will have to help them get their passports ready, prepare their necessary documents, and get everything done for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Advisory</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>You should be well versed in every place around the region you offer packages for. You must know what each place is like during every month of the year. Especially in terms of weather, climatic conditions, crime rate, rush, and political situation, among other things.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your clients are going to ask a lot of questions regarding different places before finalizing a plan. You will have to keep their goals, preferences, budget, and wishes in mind.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Make sure you guide them well, correct any misinformation they might have, and mentally prepare them for any inconvenience they are likely to face at the place they are headed to.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Manage budgets</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Entire travel plans need to be outlined according to your client&rsquo;s budget and implemented. Needless to say, you might be entertaining several clients at a time. You will have to record and follow each of those separately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to that, you must manage your own budgets like your travel agency&rsquo;s budget, the budgets allotted for different tasks and goals, maintenance budget and so on. Make sure you are getting good returns on investment while satisfying your clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Sell travel packages</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The skill of salesmanship is essential to this field. You will have to convince a person to make a deal with you. Trust you enough to not only give their money but also travel to a different place on your responsibility.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That requires some excellent skills.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Building a good relationship with your customers is the key. Once a client gets comfortable with you, they are very likely to become a long-term customer. Which means profit margin is likely to be higher afterward.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Arrange accommodation</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Arranging accommodation is one of the major parts of implementing a travel plan. As a travel agent, you have to arrange all the necessities and facilities included in your travel package.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This means night stays, trips, meals, guides, arrangements for any activities, packages for tourist attractions, and any other facilities agreed upon.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s your job to make sure your client gets all that during their journey, as well as when they reach their planned destination.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Arrange Transportation</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>From flights and trains to local drivers, taxis, and buses, you will have to keep everything that&rsquo;s included in the package ready for clients. It can mean having the routes, timings and availability planned out.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or simply get them to travel passes. Have pick and drop for airports or stations ready. Whatever that applies to their package and destination must be arranged beforehand.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Maintain Good Relations with Other Businesses</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>When you have to arrange everything for your clients and serve them best to your abilities, you make sure you&rsquo;ve got all the resources it needs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having good relations with relevant businesses can help you make the process smoother. For example, having deals from good hotels will help you arrange accommodation for your clients at the best prices.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maintaining good relations with restaurants can get you good offers and vouchers for your clients on your reference. Having connections with airlines can get you good deals on flights and seating. And so on.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Arrange tour guides</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If your clients are new to a place, they might need guidance and navigation to go about places. While google maps come in handy to almost everyone, it is better to arrange some local guidance for your clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It can be a guide for the whole trip or a person who meets once or twice to explain important things. Or it could be a helpline that connects them to your agency or your connections. Either way, it is important to have measures of navigation ready, just in case.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Arrange Insurance</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>When a client is willing to travel using your services, you will have to arrange their insurance for traveling. The facilities it covers depend on your client&rsquo;s budget. It can be the basic requirement of traveling in many countries. Taking that into account, you have to manage to get them insured.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Booking</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Booking everything included in the plan is your job. From flights, hotels, transportation to any trip and reservation. Adjusting the timings, and scheduling everything to your client&rsquo;s needs is very important.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Develop tour plans and documents</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Putting everything on paper is essential. Making a comprehensive document for a plan is very important. Along with that, arranging, compiling and getting all the required documents is your job. You will have to get all the legal and official formalities fulfilled for the client.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Administration and Management</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ll very likely have a staff working under you. Administering the staff working under you, managing the team you are working with and getting everything together is your job. All of this is crucial to implementing a client&rsquo;s travel plan successfully.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of these responsibilities require hard work, skill, acumen, patience, tact and almost every quality a person can have altogether.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about what makes you eligible to be a travel agent.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Education Prerequisites</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1573889767/adult-1835799_1280_1_horlww.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of academics, there&rsquo;s no hard and fast rule. You might not even have to have a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in the relevant field. Having a diploma can work just fine.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having relevant education, however, gives you an edge over those who don&rsquo;t have it. Here are a few fields and subjects that are considered relevant and can leverage your career as a travel agent.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Hospitality</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Studying this will make you eligible to manage hotels, tourist places, gatherings, clients, meetings and anything that has to do with hosting. As the name suggests, this field is related to entertaining and hosting people. Which requires making them comfortable and providing with services they need.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Geography</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This can help you understand landscapes, climatic conditions and other details about a variety of places. That knowledge can be helpful in planning packages, advising or guiding clients, and keeping track of the right timings and opportunities among other things.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Economics</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Managing several budgets at a time while keeping track on profit and loss is no piece of cake. Studying economics can sharpen your skills in managing money and finances.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Business</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The travel agency you run must have a business model planned out. Having complete knowledge about business can help you make the right decisions and plan everything to the best of your capabilities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you&rsquo;re planning on getting a job or building your own firm, knowledge related to business will come in handy to keep track of your Key Performance Indicators. As well as align your activities with the best interests of the firm.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Tourism</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Studying tourism as an academic field can give you in-depth knowledge about your specific role. It is obvious why this can leverage your performance as a travel agent.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Travel</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>While tourism is specific to temporary trips and visits, Travel is a subject that includes all types of traveling and journeys. Whether its immigration, trips, business or work-related journeys, student programs or anything else. This subject addresses traveling as a whole.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Practical Skills</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1573889857/utah-95032_1280_1_pyella.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be a travel agent, you need to have a combination of practical skills and experience. Most important among these is Salesmanship.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Salesmanship</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason why salesmanship has so much emphasis over it is that you need this skill at every step and stage of your plan.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From acquiring customers to building business relations and getting good deals or contracts. You have to sell ideas, products, services, trust and much more at each step of your work as a travel agent.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. Networking</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1573889947/beard-2286440_1280_hyekrc.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Networking is the life of your work. It makes every step smoother, opens better opportunities and gives you customers as well as links to pull strings on. Your entire business is based on your networking skills. Here&rsquo;s a list of some basic areas to strengthen your network.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Hotels</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Having a good network among hotels, resorts or places for lodging and stay can help you offer better accommodation to your clients. It can keep you updated with the latest packages and trends in the market. Most importantly, it can earn you a great deal of commission as well. It&rsquo;s a total win-win.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Restaurants</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Having strong links among a large variety of restaurants can get you deals and packages for large groups of travelers. Or even smaller packages as well. Like family or individual ones. This keeps giving you unique selling points and incentives to attract customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Government Officials</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of times, good links among officials can help make processes like visa and application smoother. Many candidates can be guided right through the exclusive guidelines and information you have. A lot of hurdles are removed, many times, the wait is cut short with good links, which saves time and energy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Agencies in other countries</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Having good relations with agencies in other countries can help you facilitate your clients better. You can make deals, and partner with other agencies to look out for and support your clients in other countries. This can reduce stress as they receive local help.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Tourist Attractions</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Tourist attractions are what people usually travel for. Good connections among the administration of those places can help you stand out. It can improve the experiences of your clients and get you a great deal of commitment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Transportation</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Maintaining connections among local transportation agencies in many countries can get you two things: commission, and good accommodation for your customers. It is yet another facility many people worry about. Arranging budget-friendly transportation can have clients remember you for long.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Local Guides and Businesses</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason for having connections among miscellaneous local businesses in other countries is important is that it can leverage your work. It can let you give your clients a few perks here and there.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When a complete stranger recognizes them through your reference, it builds a reputation. Not just that, it makes your customers feel safe owing to the perception, &ldquo;locals know my travel agent.&rdquo; It makes them comfortable and happier in a foreign place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting reservations for clients becomes easier as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Airlines and Trains</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Last but not least, having connections in Airlines and Trains can get you the best packages. It can help you get flights at the timings of your choice more easily. May as well get your client&#39;s seats of their choice on a train.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Staff&rsquo;s willingness to accommodate you and anyone related to you works wonders in this business.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Networking is crucial to a business. And equally important is branding. As a matter of fact, networking and branding are interrelated.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5. Branding</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1573890162/plymouth-945428_1280_ehu62u.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Branding is the image you build of yourself. People approach you, favor you, buy from you, sell to you, and have every sort of relation with you based on the brand you build for yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They decide whether to trust you or not based on your brand because the stronger your brand, the better your business. And the bigger your brand, the fewer the chances of anyone messing with you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Branding comes with marketing as well as networking. Networking is amplified with branding. It&rsquo;s a cyclic process. And the foundation of both of these is the output you deliver.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can build a brand and a network without giving any output, but it won&rsquo;t last. And it may as well backfire. If you give a great output along with networking and branding, it will multiply the effect and increase your worth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, it is essential for any business, especially a travel agency, to have a good brand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being a travel agent is no piece of cake.

How does a passion or an idea transform into a tangible means of earning?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How can you become the next leading travel agent without any lavish office or a huge team?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quite simple!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Tips to Start a Homebased Travel Agency</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Follow this course of action and you&rsquo;ll glide towards setting up a successful travel agency within weeks!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>1. Set up a Business Plan</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<h2><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574152915/concept-1868728_640_uluuof.jpg\" /></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The most significant aspect of setting up any business is to formulate its business model with a prototype serving as a cherry on top. Business models serve as blueprints for your ultimate idea that needs execution.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business plans or models depend upon the kind of funding that you will seek. A formal business plan, in this case, will be designed if you&rsquo;re looking for big investments or loans in your venture.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Otherwise, if you&rsquo;re starting from scratch and decide to self-fund your business, a lean business plan is your ideal choice!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/\">CBInsights&#39; research</a>, most startup businesses fail they think they don&#39;t need to market at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574164958/Why_Startup_Travel_Agency_Fail_dzvkzv.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most efficient way to set up a business is to abide by its business model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most efficient way to abide by a business model/plan is to just write it down and keep referring to it while making decisive choices steering the success of your business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commitment is a core value you&rsquo;ll need the most at this stage. Beware you&rsquo;re surrounded by the positive energy of your friends, family and colleagues at this tender stage!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>2. Market Research&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574152915/knowledge-1052011_640_mbqopm.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of entrepreneurs and young businessmen are already aware of or rather excited about this step. They consider they&rsquo;ll be roaming through markets, talking to established gurus in their respective fields and getting the first-hand experience of all the practicalities of the business.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let me assure you a lot of them are terribly mistaken!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Market research is quite an objective and indulging area that calls for finalizing a niche for your endeavor - the target audience, the area of service provision, etc.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this purpose, gear up for the following steps:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Visit tourist websites of the country and check for the frequently visited and enquired about places and spots</li>\r\n	<li>Study the statistical and demographic trends in tourism, especially the sector of travel agencies, in Pakistan</li>\r\n	<li>Note the costs and services of the packages they offer&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Extract any loopholes or flaws in their models or packages and make sure you either avoid them or devise ways to rectify them in your own venture</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>You should have a detailed vision of your mission and of the <em>needs, demands </em>and <em>preferences</em> of the community you&rsquo;re serving. This is the best way to connect with your target audience/clients and serve them in the most unique way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can&rsquo;t wish to arrange trips for Sibbi just because you think the place is cool while none of the Punjabis join your sentiments. This isn&rsquo;t going to work!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, you can use <a href=\"https://marketfinder.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en/discovery/\">Google Market Finder</a> to see which country would be a perfect fit for your target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574165257/Google_Market_Finder_c344lu.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>3. Searching for a Unique Element</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574152915/fantasy-2701633_640_pbiff4.jpg\" /></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The world we reside in has been altered a great deal with the advent of technology and digitalization in almost every field.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can&rsquo;t possibly believe in the soaring success of your travel agency in a country already enjoying the latest tourist facilities and permissions from the higher authorities. You need to up your game! But how? All novel ideas seem redundant now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The answer to this puzzling query lies within you! Ask yourself why you wish to start this business in the first place?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you wish to copy the existing models to make money? I&rsquo;m afraid, with such numbers of established giants in the market, there&rsquo;s little chance you reach their level by the rather simpler powers of imitation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ponder again! Don&rsquo;t you want to stand out in this area? Don&rsquo;t you want to establish your own brand name? Let me answer, yes! You see, that&rsquo;s the only option guaranteeing success and a staunch position in the market of travel agencies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Search for this unique area of service and connection with the travelers and clients through an extensive episode of an internal monologue with yourself on a calm day. This will provide all the answers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>4. Creating a Brand Image&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574153319/night-692261_640_mlphjp.jpg\" /></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Once that differentiating element has been identified, put your wits to work! Now is the time to paint the canvas of your future!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Start working on the display of your brand for your audience. Making a brand isn&#39;t an easy task because it takes time and careful planning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best way is to read the best marketing book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Marketing-Management-15-Philip-Kotler/dp/9332557187//dp/9332557187/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Marketing+Management+%2815th+Edition%29+15th+Edition&amp;qid=1574165478&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1\">Marketing Management by Philp Kotler</a>, that can help you in marketing as well as making&nbsp;your home-based travel agency a brand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574165514/Marketing_Managment_Book_zhgo4w.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>5. Make Tourist Packages&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574152914/gift-1420830_640_ztzp9e.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Start off with one-day or two-day trips that are easy to manage and arrange. Far off destinations are not suitable for these trips.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>6. Contact Resorts, Caterers and Bus Drivers&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574152915/hong-kong-4046913_640_wvus4d.jpg\" /></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Make a list of all the professionals you&rsquo;ll need to contact for the infrastructure establishment. Keep in mind some extra names in case things don&rsquo;t work out according to your plan.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You obviously wouldn&rsquo;t want the clients stranded in Hunza because the driver got sick or had to leave earlier than was decided.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keeping reserves for client comfort is a prerequisite here.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>7. Print Brochures&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574152914/magazine-2614854_640_uyfbsc.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ideal places to circulate these brochures (of course, designed by expert photoshop experts with vibrant design and vivacious color scheme) are academic institutions, coffee houses and cafes frequently visited by students.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>8. Social Media Campaigns&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574152914/media-998990_640_zy9oiu.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is so far the most crucial stage of your set up calling for advanced level skills. Handle and set up Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp account or pages if you&rsquo;re an experienced person. If not, better assign this task to some sane and experienced person who can answer all the queries in his/her bilingual ease and confidence about the agency&rsquo;s nature of work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>9. Eager to Accept Mistakes and Learn&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574152914/mistake-876597_640_smce9z.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good business venture is always a learning business venture, valuing the necessity of criticism and accountability. You and your team should be rather eager to hear criticism and show some frenzy in rectifying the errors and mismanagements. Neglecting clients&rsquo; objections and advice&nbsp;will eventually lead you into an abyss of self-praise and denial.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;re undoubtedly leading yourself to the depths of failures if this is your choice of conduct!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>10. Inculcating New Trends and Facilities</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574152915/company-3277947_640_lcvp5y.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Never rely on the consistency of time! It changes and with it, changes the whole scheme of public tastes and common interests. So, to keep your business in the game, keep a track of all the novel trends and latest discovered tourist spots with all the new facilities and fancies for its visitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, young venturers, I hope this aids you to the best of your interests and goals for setting up your unrivaled travel agency.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep exploring yourself and your abilities to help others in wandering places unknown and worth seeking!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5dd3d971c5cd7.jpg', 2142, '2019-11-19 07:46:22');

In this case, we must gather some facts, do a bit of basic calculation, and set a direction before starting anything. That ensures we don&#39;t go off track.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>1) Set a S.M.A.R.T Goal</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574247752/children-1822688_640_p4fc5e.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you really want to start a travel company, you definitely need to make a S.M.A.R.T goal that stands for&nbsp;<strong>Specific</strong>, <strong>Measurable</strong>, <strong>Achievable</strong>, <strong>Relevant</strong>, and <strong>Time-based</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When people make vague goals, they&#39;re less likely to achieve it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/markmurphy/2018/04/15/neuroscience-explains-why-you-need-to-write-down-your-goals-if-you-actually-want-to-achieve-them/\">Scientists have proved that people who write their goals</a>, they are more likely to accomplish their goals than people who don&#39;t write them down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;re still unclear, you can see the below infographic created by&nbsp;HydrateMarketing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574249847/smart_goals_marketing_hubspot_inbound_2_gfdmol.webp\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>2) Know Your Customers</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574247752/office-2539844_640_pfizze.jpg\" /></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have set a goal, the first step to it is to know travelers who are supposed to buy your services. Your customers are the ones who will help you fulfill your goal. Knowing who these customers are is crucial.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To have a clear view of your niche, you must create a <strong>buyer persona</strong>. Now, what is a buyer persona?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Buyer Persona is a character that represents your customers. You must make the buyer persona based on research on your target travel audience. The more specific it gets, the easier it becomes to work around it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574250887/Buyer_Persona_ppwqbj.jpg\" />All of your activities revolve around your buyer persona. It defines your target audience. You visualize it in your ads, and it becomes a part of every marketing campaign, which is why your target audience needs to relate to it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You might have different groups of your target audience, with different traits and interests. You can divide them into segments, and create a separate buyer persona for each of your customer segments.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>3) Costing and Budgeting</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574247752/coins-1015125_640_z1sgal.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Knowing your resources, and how to use them is vital to your business.

SEO aids you to get clients from search engines mainly from Google that counts for the majority of the traffic on the Internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You need to find low competition keywords in the travel niche market. Low competition keywords are easy to rank for. The keyword&nbsp;<strong>Travel&nbsp;</strong>would be impossible to rank, but the keyword&nbsp;<strong>Travel Agency in New York</strong>&nbsp;would be easy to rank for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you&#39;ve found the keywords, you can <a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/blog/how-long-does-it-take-to-rank/\">rank within a year because SEO takes time</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to SEO, you&#39;ll need to learn:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>On-Page SEO:&nbsp;</strong>You need to find a keyword, and you optimize your page. For example, you&#39;ve found a keyword &quot;best travel agency in your CITY&quot;, you&#39;ll use the keyword in your title, meta description and in your article.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Off-Page SEO:&nbsp;</strong>As the term suggests, this part is not under your control. You create backlinks on other sites to rank higher. Make sure you follow the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35769?hl=en\">Google Guidelines</a> to make backlinks.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The Best Resources to Learn SEO:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/blog/learn-seo/\">How to Learn SEO (and Stay Sane)</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUfMODd-4YSrC6mJyfms5ipj5zvTeJV0H\">SEO Tips That Work (Videos)</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184?hl=en\">Google Offical SEO Guide</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>2) Paid Media Ads</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574247752/ppc-4105994_640_pswwpa.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paid Ads are beneficial for leveraging your business if used right. When you know your target audience, you know what type of ads to create for them. There are plenty of channels that offer Paid Ads.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can use:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Google Ads</li>\r\n	<li>Facebook Ads</li>\r\n	<li>Instagram</li>\r\n	<li>Twitter</li>\r\n	<li>LinkedIn Ads</li>\r\n	<li>Youtube Ads</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>These are the most popular channels among other marketing platforms. They have a broad audience, and their engagement rates are high. You can pick and choose from them according to what your target audience engages with the most.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Best Resources to Learn SEO:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEzSSbs3Wfe5p4dBzzjrjvw/videos\">Surfside PPC (Videos)</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/learn?camplink=mainfooter&amp;campname=PPCU\">PPC University (Guide)</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>3) Influencer Marketing</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574247888/influencer-4492841_640_jviq3k.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Influencer marketing is when you reach out to a person that has the right amount of following, and sponsor them to endorse or market your product in their ways. These people are called influencers because they have the power to influence people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key to successful influencer marketing is getting an influencer whose followers match your target audience. Instead of going for a person with large numbers of fans and following, go with more niche-specific influencers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One reason is pretty apparent, targeting gets precise. Another reason is that influencers with a relatively smaller number of followers can create more intimate experiences. That makes their influence more effective. And they are economical most of the time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>4) Start a Referral Program</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574247754/achievement-3408115_640_ogluuh.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paid referral programs have been a part of recruitment techniques for quite a while. This tactic can be used in marketing as well. Only, this time, the one referred pays for the referral.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That means you can offer incentives to people to refer you to other potential customers. It can encourage people to perpetuate word of mouth about you. Because they get paid for each customer that walks in with their reference</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It can work well for a traveling agency like yours since it builds trust. Which makes a brand stronger.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>5) Giveaways</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574247753/arrow-964733_640_hiqciv.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Giveaways are a great way to create hype about your travel agency. A gift or incentive is something the public often rushes to get. Competitions and activities, the primary goal of which is publicity of your travel agency, can only be successful when there&rsquo;s something in it for the ones involved.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Material gifts like lucrative items or cash prizes can work, too, but the best incentive could be related to your brand. Like, a free trip, an air ticket, and some great discount vouchers for your services. A campaign offering giveaways stirs public interest and creates a higher level of engagement than other approaches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using all 5 of these combined after doing your groundwork can be a complete marketing strategy in itself. It can work well for each stage of marketing.

In older times, this trade called for a tangible infrastructure for its successor, even working. These included&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A showroom to display your fleet, i.e., all the available cars&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>An office for negotiations and all the formal proceedings&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Official permits and license&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Buying an insurance policy</li>\r\n	<li>Business cards&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Meeting clients in person for sealing the deals</li>\r\n	<li>Payment in cash&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Owing to the remarkable advancement in digitised communication and money transfer systems, this infrastructure has mostly lost its significance. Now, all you need to initiate this business is</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Some connections with people having some vehicles in good condition</li>\r\n	<li>Social media handles serving as business platforms&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>And of course, good wi-fi&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever may be the kind of trade, the entire network usually works in a tight-knit mesh of trust both from clients and the service providers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like really, if someone trusts you with his/her latest Toyota model, priced at no less than 23 lacs, then you&rsquo;re not in a position to doubt the degree of trust the renter has in this deal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what scheme must be sorted out in your mind in order to make this business work and turn out profitable and stable for as long as you wish?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just some confidence and an entrepreneurial spirit?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No! Get your notepads! You&rsquo;ve got some work to do before you crave for those crisp notes landing comfortably in your pocket!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Step 1 - Formulate a Business Plan&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574323279/hand-3190204_640_ptalau.jpg\" /></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Well, I want to start a car rental business. I know some friends who&rsquo;d be glad to rent their vehicles. I&rsquo;ve got some money for social media promotions! Yes, I can start tomorrow or even today or come on, this very moment!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know these triggering sentimental statements are fuzzing in your brain right now but hold your horses. Developing a business plan requires a proper scheme you&rsquo;ll need to follow:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Initial costs of your startup required for set up</li>\r\n	<li>How to conduct detailed market research for facts and figures aiding in the successful and stable establishment of the trade</li>\r\n	<li>Figuring out a niche for your business</li>\r\n	<li>Deciding on a target audience</li>\r\n	<li>Where do you wish to lead your venture in the coming 5 or 10 years?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Take your time finding answers to all these perplexing questions and once, you&rsquo;ve got a vision for your business, stick to it with full focus and devotion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Step 2 - Survey and Explore the Market&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574323279/japan-2014618_640_nnxwh4.jpg\" /></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This may seem gross but trust me, if you wish to pass a viva exam without even sifting through the dusty leaves of your book, you&rsquo;re pretty much residing in a utopia. If you wish your business flourishes as per your expectations, you better just go out and survey the space you think is ideal to set up the business.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>A venue for your office&nbsp;</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The first thing that needs your immediate attention is your office venue. Some car rental businessmen consider places near airports to be ideal for this setup. Some deem tourist spots to be the perfect complementary places for such an endeavour while others press on locations near universities (especially private universities where the majority of the students belong to highly privileged social class).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever may be the location, make sure you understand all the other dimensions and dynamics of the place including your competitors, the socio-economic trends of the locality, the condition of the building you&rsquo;re renting, its distance from the urban hubs etc.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The office must also be equipped with all the necessities and facilities your workforce will be demanding at the end of the day like a continuous supply of electricity, gas pipelines, water resources and obviously, it has to be the perfect spot for good wi-fi and data connection.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Competitors&nbsp;</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Make an effort to know your competitors! A fast friendship isn&rsquo;t what we ask from you, but an amicable relationship can definitely be established.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Study their mindsets and working patterns. Pick out their unique and weak points! You can either fill out their deficiencies or add your taste to their best points and present them to the market anew.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Costs&nbsp;</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Owing to the fact that the number of adventure trips has only risen in the near past, <em>profit </em>is all a naive trader thinks of while embarking on this journey. But what shall be the criterion for making this profit legitimate?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following facts need consideration when you decide on the monetary aspects of the business:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>The breakdown of the payment&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Costs extracted for business maintenance&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>A share reserved for investment in business expansion&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Bonuses for employees&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Profit for yourself!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Step 3 - Buying Perfect Car Rental Software</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574324740/Car-Rental-Software_wwxubi.jpg\" /></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The market is full of car rental software applications that are web and app-based. You&#39;ll buy their software, and the next day you&#39;d not reply to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s why it&#39;s crucial to find a perfect partner who understands your problems and can provide you with support anytime you need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We understand you and your clients better than anyone in the industry because we&#39;re empowering more than 4000+ businesses around the globe in the travel agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a class=\"btn btn-primary\" href=\"https://phptravels.com/demo/\">Experience our demo</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Step 3 - Register Your Business&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574323280/binding-contract-948442_640_bmmi0w.jpg\" /></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The social media aficionados will jump at this point, claiming that the other businesses using social media platforms for their promotions and interactions work just fine without any glitches or reservations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another group of revolting opponents may come up with the excuse that they rent cars among themselves and their acquaintances quite often and it works out pretty good.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So why should one bother to make one&rsquo;s car rental business registered?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you really think handing over a person&rsquo;s car or one from your own fleet to a stranger who merely provides you with a small amount of advance and some identity papers is a wise course of action? A big, bold NO!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Registering your business with government and national authorities helps you in two ways&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>You have the confidence of the state since you pay them heavy loads of taxes. This way if a client causes any inconvenience with regards to payments or his/her behavior, you have a reliable body to complain to.</li>\r\n	<li>Having the reputation of a registered business attracts more customers, sponsors and car providing individuals since they know you&rsquo;re one tangible body and can hardly cheat them.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Step 4 - Build Your Fleet&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574323279/car-1149997_640_i8lg5w.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have been able to figure out the essential beginning points for a car rental business so far, but really, we haven&rsquo;t talked business yet!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where are the cars - the sleek Hondas, the shimmering Hyundais, the boisterous Audis?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where&rsquo;s the real deal?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two ways you&rsquo;re going to set up your vehicles for the business:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>If you&rsquo;re someone with a rich network of acquaintances and friends who further have a huge social circle, then building a fleet is really not that hard. Call your friends and their friends, your cousins and their cousins and hence, the chain shall provide you with a considerably long list of people ready to work with you.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>This is how it works best and without any trouble for huge investment - their car, your platform, everybody&rsquo;s a benefit!</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>The other way is to buy your own fleet. this may include all the new models (mostly preferred for business and family vacation trips) or some old cars in perfect conditions (students will understand why it&rsquo;s necessary these vehicles remain in business)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>The second option is a bit outdated now but works best for people who either are very accomplished (rich of course) or are big risk-takers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For starters, this guideline works best. Once you step into this game, all queries are easily resolved and you start enjoying this business forming new interactions and providing a huge plethora of opportunities!&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5dd64cdb35564.jpg', 1815, '2019-11-21 07:51:25'),

Do luring landscapes and enchanting monuments instill the urge to explore more of your city or country in you?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have you ever thought of quitting your monotonous 9 to 5 job and spend some quality time in the bounds of culture, art, history and nature?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That sounds like a far off dream, existing only in our minds and desires, right?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wrong! What if I tell you that there&rsquo;s one way you can enjoy your life the way you want and get some or rather an adequate amount of money out of it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Passion and money, hand in hand? Seems more unreal now!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But just hold onto the conception for a bit more. Here&rsquo;s an effort to prove the apparently irrational and risky proposition!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Establishing a tour agency or business is the answer to all your urges of making your life more fun, more meaningful, more worthy. Tour businesses differ from travel agencies in mainly one element - a guide! The rest of the procedure is essentially similar.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jumping onto an integral part right away wouldn&rsquo;t be wise enough. So let&rsquo;s do this step by step.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a detailed road map with some maxims and advice to follow before you start knitting the dream of a prosperous and thrilling set up of a tour business:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>1. Talk to Yourself&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574872889/man-1483479_640_eowuhw.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we do it all the time - in stress, in confusion, amidst quarrels and repentance. So what&rsquo;s new about it while planning a business?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simply this!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A tour agency or business differs significantly from other business ventures. It demands from you an overwhelming interest in its affairs, your utmost devotion dwelling in its planning and an eagerness to endeavor beyond traditional orthodox ideas.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to make your venture profitable and interesting for yourself, you&rsquo;ll have to enquire yourself on some crucial points:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Why am I doing this in the first place? Is it for mere fun, an urge for socializing with people from all walks of life or just money-making?</li>\r\n	<li>What is my vision behind this venture? Making people aware of the history and culture of my region, connecting people from different professions and locales to promote harmony and peace etc.&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Why take it as a business? What are the skills you have or will require to initiate the venture?&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>With these starters settled in your mind, you&rsquo;re good to go! The rest of the voyage continues with less trouble.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>2. Decide on a Dimension</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574872889/women-1209678_640_jsk7dy.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A dimension can be taken as a niche for your business. You must know what&rsquo;ll keep you going through the monotonous schedule of trips and business meetings and procedures once you feel settled in the venture. If unable to identify that, you&rsquo;re probably going to lose all interest in just a couple of months and end up drenched in vows and loans and a deep sense of futility and despair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To choose a niche, this is the set of elements to be finalized:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Evaluate the places</strong> you&rsquo;ll arrange tours for. Visit their markets, research on their historical and cultural sites, talk to natives for stories and facilities to attract the tourists etc.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Pick out your target audience. </strong>Accepting anyone for any trip is the worst technique you&rsquo;ll be adopting. Try to stick to just one type of audience e.g, university students. Gather up knowledge about their first options for tourist places. This will keep you &ldquo;in the game&rdquo; and help maintain a sense of calm while planning tours.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The target audience can be approached with respect to professions, passions, age groups and fields of study etc.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>3. Get to Paperwork&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574872889/laptop-3196481_640_odb86d.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This seems bizarre beyond words but hey, we live in a state. This can&rsquo;t be left out or you&rsquo;ll land yourself in big trouble.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Choose a unique name for your business. This doesn&rsquo;t have to sound out of the world but from within a clear perspective you hold for your endeavor.&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>Visit tourist promoting sites and institutions in your city or province like Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation (operating on national level) or Tourism Development Corporation of Punjab (operating on the provincial level)</li>\r\n	<li>Talk to the agencies involved in registering your business&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Get an official license and insurance policy for making the venture credible and trustworthy for your customers and workers&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>For smooth transactions in a digitized age, get your venture an official bank account by its name&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This step will break your flow. Don&rsquo;t let your determination fall prey to this sluggish business of official registration. Hold onto it for the real magic lying ahead.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>4. Carve out Your Tour Plans</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574872890/wanderer-455338_640_rmoich.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now kicks in your passion, creativity and skill set!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tours can be arranged according to your initial investment in the business. The best way to be cost-effective is to locate culturally and aesthetically rich places near your head office or residential city.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Decide on these terms before calling out for customers and groups for the tour:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>The places for the tour.</strong> These should be promising in either their cultural or historical appeal, their scenic beauty or their national significance&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li><strong>The costs.</strong> These may vary according to the customers you&rsquo;ll take for a certain trip. Break down all the expenses involved in the tour and try keeping them reasonable. BUT never compromise on the quality of your services or facilities. You wouldn&rsquo;t want each of your tour to accompany a multitude of complaints and unhappy customer reviews.&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li><strong>The time schedule.</strong> This depends upon the audience as well as the place where you&rsquo;re taking your customers. Elaborate trips stretching to weeks hardly attract much audience. One-day or two-day trips work best in Pakistan</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>5. Create a Unique Advertising Strategy</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574872889/city-690158_640_1_hgjqgx.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Designing an advertising strategy that is true to your purpose and goal and attracts a huge number of customers is your real task. There are plenty of tour advisors and agents out there. Why should a person trust or consult you? This is what you&rsquo;ll be thinking about to make it count for you and your audience!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about this step here. We&rsquo;ve got your back!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just trust us with these steps if you want to stand out amongst your competitors:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>6. Build your brand name&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574775802/concept-1868728_640_1_avnfqm.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your brand name is your identity and selling mark!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you wish to make and leave your mark among a plethora of all sorts of tour agencies, opt for a brand name that&rsquo;s S.M.A.R.T (Surprising, meaningful, aesthetic, rare and trendy).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>7. Design a Logo&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574872889/harley-davidson-1905281_640_nqdkby.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hire a professional logo designer and construct a strong image of your brand. You shall have a say in the design as much as the designer himself to create a bond with it that&rsquo;s everlasting and special for you. Search out some trends in logo making before you decide on the final design.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>8. Social Media Handles&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574775801/social-media-1795578_640_qcspwb.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your social media handles describe your entity the right way. Make them&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Responsive</li>\r\n	<li>Creative&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Advertising&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Respectful</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>in the right way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hire people for this task who care about your venture and passion.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>9. Choose the Right Guide</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574696267/hand-3190204_640_1_o1yqdz.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your guide is the pivot of your voyage. Choose someone for this task who has got the P.E.R.K factor in him&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Professional </strong>yet sensitive towards your endeavour&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Enthusiastic </strong>about his/her work</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Respectful </strong>to your customers since they&rsquo;re going to interact with him the most&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Knowledgeable </strong>about the historical exploits and indigenous norms and practices of the place being visited&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>When all is set according to the plan, just remember that erecting the structure of a building is relatively easy for beginners. The real task lies ahead i.e, maintaining the infrastructure in its best state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, enjoy your tour business with as much zest as responsibility as was present when you built the first dream!&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5de27da1d0b40.jpg', 1864, '2019-11-27 16:49:21'),
(77, 1, 'How Do Travel Agents Make Money? (8 Top Ways)', 'how-do-travel-agents-make-money', '<p>Where do travel agents get their money from? How do they earn? What is their business model? What are their revenue streams?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Questions like these often bug us. Especially when you are someone contemplating becoming a travel agent. Your mind must be going back and forth between questions like, how will I get by? What sources of income will I have? What to focus on in order to earn well?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These questions are completely valid, and you are smart if you have been thinking about it way ahead of your career. We will be discussing this topic in detail today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A travel agent doesn&rsquo;t just have one revenue stream. Travel agents have multiple sources of income. The most lucrative part of being a travel agent is the fact that you can earn from each of your work operations, in the process of satisfying just one client. Imagine having multiple such clients.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While being a travel agent isn&rsquo;t an easy job; it entails responsibility, management, and a great level of accountability; it all pays off in the end. It is worth the effort when you have the potential to handle it well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How does it work? Let&rsquo;s walk you through some of the most common ways travel agents earn.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>1. Fees for Serving Clients</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574874333/credit-card-1583534_640_cv5c8o.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Planning, booking, getting the paperwork done, arranging transport, ensuring other facilities, using connections to make the process smoother and outlining a detailed plan, are some of the many tasks travel agents do for their clients.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These require a lot of work. Not to mention the responsibility travel agents have to keep the clients safe and satisfied. All of these services have their charges. Which clients pay their travel agents, in return for the trust and satisfaction they are given.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This alone can be a considerable amount, but you can still earn more by offering greater variety in services.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>2. Consultancy Charges</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574874284/office-1209640_640_e9c1z1.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another way you can earn from your clients is by becoming their advisor. Your clients are likely going to need some help making travel plans. And they might not have all the information they need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s where you step in and become their consultant. You can guide them about the best places according to climate, seasons, timings, security, political situations, and cost et cetera. Keeping their preferences in mind should be the priority.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This can earn you some extra bucks, or a hefty amount. It depends on your market value, clients and quality. Some may charge as low as $50, some might go up to $500-$1000. Others may even charge more. You have to gauge what suits you and your target audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Travelers aren&rsquo;t the only customer segment a travel agent has. Travel agents have multiple customer segments, and partners. They interact with each other on the basis of profits they get.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While discussing other streams of revenue, we will touch the topic of different customer segments of travel agents ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>3. Commissions</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574874284/house-4101306_640_ewax0p.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from travelers, travel agents can make money through commissions. In fact, commissions are a great percentage of travel agents&rsquo; income. But how do commissions work?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissions are a percentage of profit you get when your client buys from someone through you. By now, it might be obvious where we&rsquo;re going with this.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever travel agents book and buy for their clients, they earn a commission on it. This makes every business related to hospitality, accommodation and everything that interests a traveler, the travel agent&rsquo;s potential customer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It might sound unfair to some travelers, but if you think about it, the travel agent takes responsibility of customer&rsquo;s satisfaction by doing that. Chances of scams and fraud are reduced quite a lot. The places are verified and customers have someone to hold accountable. Satisfaction is guaranteed, not only by the businesses, but travel agents as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Travel agents have deals and contracts with many companies for that. Which means, their commission is decided and agreed upon. But why would those companies pay commission?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Travel agents work like marketers and influencers for them. They have a pool of customers, and they have the ability to channel those towards businesses. They take responsibility to make both parties happy. Which makes it a win-win.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, who are these other customer segments?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some of the most common customers for travel agents apart from travellers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>4. Hotels</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574874284/hotel-1749602_640_bb6jiw.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Travellers need stays and accommodation wherever they go. It is their basic need. On the other hand, hotels and lodges need to make their presence count in the market get by. For that, they need customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Travel agents connect the two parties. Which is why hotels pay travel agents for referring them to the right customers. The commission per customer makes the game fair and square.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>5. Airlines</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574874285/plane-841441_640_h1tnwf.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are multiple airlines offering air travel. All of them need passengers to earn and keep running. While travellers need a way to get to their destinations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people can book flights and handle the process on their own. But when planning to travel through an agent, the idea is to have most of their things taken care of. Air tickets included.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Travel agents are a channel for another revenue stream for Airlines. Which is why they often pay commissions per passenger or offer packages to agents.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>6. Restaurants</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574874286/restaurant-449952_640_w9ct59.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In many cases, food and other facilities are a part of the travel plan. Travel agents can provide a good number of coupons and packages for that. Restaurants pay commission to get international customers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alternatively, they can offer to give discounts on the travel agent&rsquo;s reference, which can help travel agents attract clients. Or they can do a mix of both and add some deals. It depends on the deals travel agents make with restaurants.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>7. Transport Services</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574874284/car-3046424_640_kp5prs.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Travellers need transportation wherever they go. Some can take trains instead of flights. Almost all of them need to pick and drop services. Many of them will need local or regional transport to go to places.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transport companies are often willing to pay commissions to have customers like that. Booking city tours, cab service, and any transport service can earn travel agents commission. Some can sell travel passes as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>8. Cruises</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574874284/ferry-boat-123059_640_e2cxki.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruises are a great tourist attraction. People travel by sea and lakes to enjoy a great deal. Which means they pay a lot to have it. Travellers can book rooms if their journey is longer than a day. And they can book dinners, lunches, or any of the services offered there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruises have a hard time selling initially because not everyone affords them. But the ones who do, if satisfied, can become recurring customers. Even if they don&rsquo;t come again, they are likely to refer these to their circle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Travel agents are one of the catalysts for this process. They filter the customers themselves and send the right ones to the cruise. With great price comes proportionately great commission.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>9. Other Ways</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574874285/tent-548022_640_tl4fkp.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are miscellaneous tourist attractions and activities that can give a great number of earnings. Arrangement of these can not only attract clients but also get some commission from their providers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, water sports, paragliding, and camping to name a few. These businesses thrive on income from tourists. Having dealt with them can prove to be very beneficial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all, travel agents can make some good money through various sources. Which means they don&rsquo;t have to rely on commissions from one place or area. Being a travel agent can be as fruitful as any business. Perhaps even more.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><br />\r\n&nbsp;</h1>\r\n', '', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5de27debe1ff3.jpg', 10930, '2019-11-15 17:10:02'),

In this article, we&rsquo;ll teach you how to start a travel agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While planning your holiday, it becomes a lot difficult to buy affordable tickets, look for the perfect accommodation, and deciding about all those places which you&rsquo;ll visit. Travel agencies make it easy for you.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During this era of technology, people prefer to get information online and book their tickets rather than consulting an agent. This aspect took the businesses of travel agents quiet down. But, there are still some people who trust offline travel agencies over online ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you&rsquo;re opening a travel agency online or offline, there are some things that you need to know.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should always remember that anything new in the market still has more risk and more competitors. People tend to prefer and trust older agencies more because there are more scammers in the market than the actual travel agents. It will be a bit tough while starting your new travel agency, but if you make efforts and follow some basics, your business will surely succeed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>10 Steps to Start a Travel Agency</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Following are the basics that will help you to start and run your business as a travel agent</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 1 - Select Your Niche</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574962278/map-846083_640_rcnefa.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A common mistake that travel agents make while starting their business is that they start doing the business on a larger scale from the very beginning without knowing the consequences. You first have to select your niche that what kind of services you will provide.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a lot of competition in the market, so if you start doing your business without knowing about anything, you&rsquo;ll be left behind. You have to target a particular segment of the market, and in this way, you can lessen the competition around you. You can conduct market research to find out what services your competitors are still not providing so you can focus on that particular service/services.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 2 - Make Plan for Your Business</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574962277/checklist-2077020_640_hfvjbq.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plan is the most important thing while starting a long term project. Your plan must not include random objectives and goals but proper thinking and strategies. These strategies will help you, in the long run, to compete with your competitors. These small steps guide you to achieve your ultimate goal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your business must define its clear vision and mission. You should be able to know where you will get your funds. Make sure to estimate the cost that will start your travel agency and acquire the funds according to that.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 3 - Fulfill All the Legal Requirements</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574962279/contract-945619_640_ffnhey.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To start your travel agency, first, you have to fulfill all the legal requirements for that. Every country has its laws and regulations, and for that, you can contact the host agency that will let you know about the registration process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, you have to get a trademark for the business. For any business, the logo of that business is its trademark, so you have to create a logo first to obtain a brand.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 4 - Acquire Some Funds</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574962278/coins-1726618_640_wehzbc.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to set up your travel agency online, then you must be working from home. In that case, your relatives or family members might help you out in funding. But you still need some funds if you have created a website and some other person is running that, and you have to pay him/her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your business is offline, you need a proper location, office and employees for that, and a flow of money is significant for that. So, you can acquire a bank loan or get cash from a person whom you can trust.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 5 - Pick a Perfect Place</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574962278/entrepreneur-593371_640_qempxt.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Location plays a vital role in the success of any business. Pick a place where it is easy for people to find you and where your signboard is visible to them. If your office is in the main street or road, people might read your signboard while passing by. If your location has facilities like car parking or it is not so far from the main road, it will have a great impression on your customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As many people don&rsquo;t have many expenses at the start of a business and can&rsquo;t afford an expensive location, go for the second-best convenient location. Moreover, build your office according to your plans, in case if your employees increase in the future, your office must be big enough to accommodate them all.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 6 - Promotion of Your Travel Agency</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574962278/megaphone-1480342_640_bvxvhj.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A quick way towards the success of any business is its promotion. As many people don&rsquo;t know about the new companies, you have to advertise about them on your own. You can publish ads in the local newspapers or make brochures and keep them in your office.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In today&rsquo;s modern world, social media plays a vital role. You should do marketing on different social sites such as Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, and Twitter. You may find your potential clients here. Try to make your accounts unique and stay active. Respond to people as soon as people. It will create the right brand image of your travel agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 7 - Try to Build Customer Relationship</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574962278/office-2539844_640_gjndvu.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No business can survive without paying attention or giving importance to its clients. You should train your staff so well that you don&rsquo;t get any complaints from your customers. Your employees, such as drivers, tour guides, and local cooks, should know how to treat people on their holidays.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your clients have any complaints, you should be able to resolve it as soon as possible. Just apologize to them and make sure that it will not happen again. Conduct different surveys from time to time so that you can improve your business.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 8 - Make Partners</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574696268/business-3167295_640_npt0k7.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One can&#39;t run a travel agency on its own. When you offer services like selling tickets, packages, and other things to your customers, where do you get this?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, you don&rsquo;t sell it on your own. First, you have to contact some established travel companies and get their permission to sell their packages via your travel agency. But it will not be that easy. They first ask you some questions like what percentage of commission you will charge. So, keep in mind the interest you&rsquo;ll tell them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, keep in mind that your business is not at a stage to demand something big. You need the support of those companies; they don&rsquo;t need yours. So, in the beginning, keep your demand low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should also be able to gain their trust and earn respect from such big companies. Once they get to know that you can sell their packages well, they might increase your commission as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 9 - Optimize Your Business</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574962278/ux-787980_640_mwrxkv.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>People usually search for things online first rather than going outside. Create a website for your travel agency and use the right keywords, which you might think will help you to gain more potential customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 10 - Be Practical</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1574962279/arrow-2889040_640_awpmgt.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some travel agents relax in their offices and wait for the customers to come on their own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t work. You have to step out of your comfort zone to gain something. Advertise your business, make efforts, and reach more and more people. Success will surely be in your way.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Bottom Line!</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>These were the steps that will help you on how to start a travel agency. We hope this article will help you in starting your travel agency and also to make your way towards success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5de27d87226d0.jpg', 4289, '2019-11-28 17:27:14');

(79, 1, 'How Travel Agents Save You Money But Agencies Fail', 'how-travel-agents-save-you-money', '<p>In this era of digital and automated services, there are plenty of arguments in favour of online travel agencies. However, there is still no match for a human to human interaction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While many people prefer online travel agencies because it seems convenient, there are still many things only Travel Agents can offer. Even though online travel agencies make you feel like you&rsquo;re saving money, a lot of times, it is quite the opposite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s talk in a bit more detail about how travel agents save you money in ways agencies can&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>1. Instalments</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1575049024/money-2696234_640_cu05uf.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you choose a travel agent over online travel agencies, you have the option to pay a deposit to confirm the trip. And clear the pending payment later. That is never an option in an online travel agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Online travel agencies require you to pay in advance to confirm your trip. Which means you have to have the entire amount ready beforehand. There can be times when you can&rsquo;t arrange all the money immediately.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having a travel agent works best for such times. They can confirm your trip for a deposit which is a small part of the total amount.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>2. Debt</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1575049023/credit-squeeze-522549_640_phkkfu.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Online travel agencies require you to pay upfront. When you can&rsquo;t arrange the entire amount immediately, you are likely to use a credit card. Which can mean you might get some credit card debt on you.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That debt increases with interest, which can cost you more than the actual trip? It is better to choose a travel agent in this case. Travel agents never push you to pay for everything upfront. Which means you don&rsquo;t have to get debt. You can schedule your payment for later when the cash is arranged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This gives you flexibility, as well as saves you money. These are two good monetary advantages you get when you choose a travel agent over online travel agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>3. Incentives</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1575049432/money-1604921_640_fcuyvz.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While online travel agencies usually start from constant rates, travel agents have the flexibility to offer early-bird incentives. This means that the earlier you approach them, the better deals and discounts you are likely to get.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, online travel agencies have rates fed into their systems. These systems don&rsquo;t usually take your timings and turn into account while stating prices. Travel agents are humans that remember you if you approach them a little while after your first meeting. Algorithms don&rsquo;t.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This makes a difference in the way they charge you for their services. Apart from that, there are other perks that human to human interaction entails, such as perks of being a long-term customer, networking, referrals and other social benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>4. Lock Your Spot</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1575049024/neon-1191281_640_xxslbm.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There can be times when you aren&rsquo;t entirely sure, but you&rsquo;re afraid you might miss out if you don&rsquo;t reserve it. Times when there&rsquo;s still a confirmation to be made before you finalise, and it can take a few hours, or even a day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For such times, travel agents have the flexibility of 24 hours for you. While online travel agencies never reserve a deal or seat for you unless you pay in advance. Travel agents can lock or hold an agreement for you - without you having to pay for it - for an entire day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This means the price will be locked, and your spot will be reserved for a day. It can prevent any sudden fluctuation in price, as well as reserve your place in case that deal gets sold out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can cancel that reservation without repercussions. And if you don&rsquo;t respond in the given time, it is considered cancelled automatically. This makes things easy, budget-friendly as well as flexible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>5. Hold Tickets</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1575049024/admission-2974645_640_ibwi8l.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like locking a deal or a package, you can put your air tickets on hold as well. The air tickets can stay locked until the end of the travel agent&rsquo;s business day. This has many advantages. Monetary as well as others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all, you won&rsquo;t have to worry about the tickets being sold out by the time you confirm it. Secondly, during rush hour, prices fluctuate &ndash; more like a spike &ndash; a lot. One minute, the prices are reasonable, the other minute, they can push you over the edge.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To save yourself from that, you can put an air ticket on hold. That reserves the seat for you. This will lock a certain price for you till the end of that business day. Which means, it becomes easier for you to make up your mind. And it costs no money.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This kind of service is usually offered by certain travel agents only. An online travel agency does not offer that kind of service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Putting an air ticket on hold might sound similar to the Dot 24 Hour Rule. But these two must not be confused. There&rsquo;s a big difference between these two.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dot 24 Hour is a rule where you can cancel a flight ticket within 24 hours, provided it was booked a week prior to the flight. In this case, you&rsquo;ve already paid for the tickets. Getting a refund for it usually takes time. And there&rsquo;s also a risk of getting no refund at all. It&rsquo;s a gamble.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whereas putting tickets on hold means you can reserve tickets for yourself any day, regardless of when the flight is. And there&rsquo;s no hassle for a refund either. This is something only a travel agent can do for you. Without even having to pay in advance, your travel agent holds a seat for you.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This saves money, time and energy. Which means you&rsquo;re taking little to no monetary risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>6. Customer Service</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1575049024/bar-984527_640_mbk4ue.jpg\" /><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>One on one customer service is something Online Travel Agencies don&rsquo;t usually provide. And when they do, it is mostly meant for issues and major confusions regarding the services. Travel Agents, on the other hand, are at your beck and call most of the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, how does it give you any monetary benefits?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you are using an online travel agency, you are the one researching the most part. Research to plan your trip, compare it with other deals and so on. If you are not well-versed with the market, you will likely not know where exactly to look, to find the best deals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s where travel agents come in handy. With their experience and knowledge about the market, they can orally list out plenty of deals. For example, you might be craving for a trip to a hilly place. So researched a few places you knew.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What your travel agent can do here is to tell you about more places you can pick and choose from. Many options among them might turn out cheaper than what you were initially considering. This can save you money, time and ensure your trip is worth the adventure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all, travel agents can turn out to be quite economical if you choose the right ones. They can take a great burden off of your shoulders. The time and energy you save by their services can be utilised in more productive things. That might earn you wealth, health and opportunities.</p>\r\n', '', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5de27d644c193.jpg', 1892, '2019-11-29 17:47:29'),
(80, 1, 'How to Get Corporate Clients for Travel Agency', 'how-to-get-corporate-clients-for-travel-agency', '<p>When marketing and attracting customers, corporate niche stands out quite a lot from other niches. Reason being their entirely different requirements, needs, tastes and preferences. How do you catch their attention? What makes them tick? How to convert them into customers?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regular marketing tactics might not work in the corporate sector. While personalised, informal and more straightforward approaches work on most of the niches. Corporate sector doesn&rsquo;t work that way. They like formal, graceful and impressionable approaches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, virtual approaches may work for many niches. But corporate niche requires more tangible and material ways of marketing, along with virtual approaches. They look for the element of substantiality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The real question is, what do you do to add the elements they seek?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about a few things you can apply that have higher chances of working on a corporate niche.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>1. Networking</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1575050682/startup-594090_640_coih7b.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Networking works best among corporate people. They prefer referrals and connections over ads or distant approaches.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is because they are hardwired to choose things they can trust. They trust what&rsquo;s within reach, responsive, and tangible. Pretty much why referrals work like magic in the job market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, good links create an impression of substantiality. It is perceived as roots. The more links you have, the stronger your roots seem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Build good connections between Business people and corporations. Especially the ones who have the authority to arrange and tweak business trips or corporate tours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take things to the next level. Offer incentives in the name of friendship. Be willing to give favours to earn their goodwill. Be sure not to look desperate. Just make the impression that you are resourceful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Follow up with and renew connection every once in a while. This keeps them from forgetting any significant details about you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Make sure they know you are a travel agent and can arrange corporate tours. This way, they will remember you when they have a trip coming up.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You will have to learn several types of sales pitches. Have yourself ready for those who show interest in your corporate packages. It is never too early for a potential customer to be interested in details.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who knows, they might happen to have something coming up where they might need your services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another benefit of networking is that it can trigger word of mouth among corporate people if done right, which can, in turn, lead to more links and publicity.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>2. Marketing</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1575050682/japan-2014618_640_1_k6truj.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When marketing in the corporate sector, make sure you focus more on physical and real-life approaches. A great chunk of corporate people associates tangibility with substantiality. And substantiality with strength and power.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But before that, you must know who you are targeting. There are different niches in the corporate sector as well. Make sure you tailor your marketing strategy according to the specific niche you are targeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>3. Targeting</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1575050682/darts-102919_640_m2njrh.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Different types of corporations have different needs, preferences, organisational culture, tastes and policies. Be sure to know what your niche&rsquo;s needs are and what they want.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some examples of different niches in the corporate sector are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Lawyers</li>\r\n	<li>Businessmen</li>\r\n	<li>Directors and corporate executives</li>\r\n	<li>Local as well as international event managers</li>\r\n	<li>Firms and international recruitment agencies</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>All of these have different purposes for travelling. While lawyers are often travelling to meet clients and resolve legal issues, recruitment agencies might be sending candidates overseas for selection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Businessmen might be going to pitch ideas and get contracts. Directors and corporate executives might be on round to monitor other branches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Event managers might be going to set up an event such as a destination wedding. Or an international marathon. Or maybe a competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The point is, all of these will need different types of accommodation, transportation, venues and facilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some may need an executive pick and drop vehicle. Some might need a limo. Others may just do well with cabs. Many might need buses.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some may need a normal stay with peace and quiet while others may need some special arrangements to get by.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many corporate people need to book a venue for meetings. They may have different requirements for meeting rooms as well. Some might want to have technological equipment available in meeting rooms while others want a simple setting with good refreshments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creating a separate strategy for each ensures you highlight the right things in front of the right people. You can further narrow down and make your targeting more specific. You can target specific corporations separately.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>4. Events</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1575050682/audience-945449_640_etvp5g.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sponsoring corporate events like training programs can help you a lot. You should play major roles in arranging and sponsoring relevant events. This can leverage your results by having people memorised your name.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goal is to show your presence at corporate events like dinners, meetings, workshops, conferences and similar events. And have your contact details visible as well as repeated orally several times.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You have to ensure that people leave the event with your name stuck in their head. And your name should be associated with travelling as much as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to build a stronger brand and have the resources, go ahead and hold networking events. Gatherings and PR development parties can attract executives &mdash; especially people who want to develop connections among resourceful and prestigious people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There, you can have your travel agency and packages marketed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>5. Starter Deals &amp; Packages</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1575050682/gift-1420830_640_1_sc3v5x.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You must introduce packages and deals designed to fulfil corporate needs. Keep every facility that corporate people need in mind while designing these. Pay attention to the details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To kick start your cycle, you will have to attract customers, even if it means having little to no profit. Introduce travel packages that are economical. Before making bigger deals, corporations are likely to try you out through smaller deals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To encourage them to try you out, you will have to decrease their hesitation. One way to do it is to reduce the monetary risk factor. Offer services in rates that they feel somewhat comfortable spending on something entirely new.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, you can offer other incentives. Like free lunches and dinners at formal venues. Or bookings for meeting rooms and such corporate-related facilities. Have these ready with good vouchers or at discounted rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>6. Digital Promotion</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1575050682/ipad-820272_640_mwrk5h.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digital promotion is as important as the real-life connection. You must ensure that people who see you in real life are able to find your business online. This makes it easier to contact you or get more details about you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Corporate people use social media, but the channels they use are very different from other niches. While people mostly use Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and similar channels. Corporate people usually use:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>LinkedIn&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Skype&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Email&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>WhatsApp</li>\r\n	<li>Cloud Storage&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Explore all of these and find your specific niche in there. Once you&rsquo;ve done that, start making well-targeted content, and promote it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are some of the ways you can get customers from a niche as unique as corporate people. And that&rsquo;s how you get corporate clients.</p>\r\n', '', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5de27d3da54d8.jpg', 4346, '2019-11-29 18:34:10'),

Do you need help devising a meticulous marketing strategy? Look no further because we have your recipe for success!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Social media is the most effective tool a business can have in its arsenal, provided it is used wisely. It offers considerable scale benefits to all the parties involved: a business can find unlimited promotion online, whereas people can compare and select products from the comfort of their homes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best site business can use Instagram due to its widespread global outreach. However, one has to be aware of the difficulties that may arise in online promotion, as, due to an increased reliability on the internet, competition, as well as scamming, has increased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To grasp the attention of an audience, we will show you exactly how to gain their trust and sell your amazing packages. Just follow these ten steps to promote your travel agency through Instagram.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. Build A Complete Account</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/c_scale,w_650/v1575115931/jakob-owens-WUmb_eBrpjs-unsplash_mx7gfk.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To do this, you must give your accurate and active contact numbers, email, and the place where your business is located in. Providing your information will set you up as an official travel agency and will lend to your audience the assurance they need in such a vast marketplace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another benefit would an increase in audience, as some people may prefer to communicate with you on one of the platforms you have given, other than Instagram itself, to gain a proper understanding of your business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone wants to make sure they&rsquo;re allocating their money in the right place, and the trust you build in the initial stages of your promotion is vital to this.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Partner up with travel bloggers/influencers</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1575113906/men-1979261_640_wjyf9w.jpg\" />Bloggers and influencers have a good following on social media platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Partnering with them will reap generous benefits as your agency will not only get exposure to their accounts; it will reach precisely the right audience for your particular niche.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This focused marketing technique will save you resources and time and gain you those that are interested in buying your product.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Advertise on Instagram</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1575115921/will-francis-r02wxT3-PYw-unsplash_mydykq.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have the funds, you can use Instagram&rsquo;s option of advertisement to promote your business and target an audience that is interested in traveling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The advertisement can either be placed in the stories or posts, according to the option you select and will place you in the audience&rsquo;s books by distinguishing your place in the Instagram community.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. Use Hash-tags to distinguish yourself</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1575115899/lego-1862121_640_j3byse.jpg\" />You must use targeted hashtags on every post you share concerning your job, your packages, the locations you have mentioned and so forth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instagram, a site bustling with businesses, where one can easily be drowned out, is made easy through hash-tags; they work as an effective medium of placing you in an area of the community you intend to be in, and will regularly update you in the circle of those who are interested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, you will attain the audience you want to be dealing with.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5. Use relevant geo-locations</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1575115899/web-3120321_640_b6woon.png\" />Along with the right set of hashtags, you can also use geo-location with your posts for the locations you are targeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your posts will become readily available to the people who show interest in these particular places and look them up in the discover section on Instagram.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Geolocations can also make a product infinitely attractive to the audience as it gives a sense of realism and can be used to thoroughly search the place in question, by browsing through the pictures available.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>6. Shout-out from the audience</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/c_scale,w_640/v1575115929/priscilla-du-preez-Q7wGvnbuwj0-unsplash_juvxxt.jpg\" />This step is essential as it builds your relationship with the audience. To achieve this, you must follow back some members of your audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can share their experiences or any travel-related post of theirs that concerns your business, after getting their permission, on your account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It will not only build a liking for your agency in the community but will also build trust, which, as discussed before, is inherently vital in a place like the Internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This step will make you famous too, especially in the circle of the person whose post you have shared, and will get you more audience and outreach.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>7. Post-eye-catching photography&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/c_scale,w_640/v1575115917/reinhart-julian-WxM465oM4j4-unsplash_kjxuv3.jpg\" />You may collaborate with a blogger for this as well, or you may hire a professional on your own, but unique photography of the locations you are targeting is essential for attracting people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Should you appeal to the visual senses of an audience, getting your message across will become a million times easier, especially because you are promoting your business on Instagram, a site primarily known for its platform for photography.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your posts are aesthetic and vibrant, it will be easier to garner attention through the methods above hash-tags, geo-location, and advertisement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>8. Associate with other platforms by Facebook</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/c_scale,w_640/v1575115926/tim-bennett-OwvRB-M3GwE-unsplash_zmruum.jpg\" />Facebook is the parent company of Instagram, as well as specific other highly used sites. It can be used to your advantage by linking your Instagram account with Facebook and further advertising on Facebook by targeting the desired audience for your niche.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If advertising is a costly venture for your business as of yet, you can create an active Facebook profile and collaborate with specific travel-related communities there, or join traveling groups that allow the promotion and self-promote your agency, while also constructing a relationship with your audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You must update both Instagram and Facebook accounts side by side and professionally post similar content, so as not to lose your audience on either one of the sites.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>9. Use discounts to garner attention</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/c_scale,w_640/v1575115927/dan-burton-w3TwyZMlfPg-unsplash_ownnfr.jpg\" />We are all aware of the fact that discounts entice people more than anything else in the business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Loads of enterprises join Instagram daily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to set yourself apart in your niche faster than the pace you currently possess, you can offer Early-Bird discounts or a general discount for being new in the community, if you can afford to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It will surely attract people to your packages and will help pass along word of your travel agency faster than any other method.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>10. Maintain a cordial and helpful relationship with your community&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1575115901/handshake-3382503_640_qv1nfe.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You must reply to all the queries of your audience helpfully and calmly. Do not take long to respond, or you will lose your audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Should you focus on this, your professionalism will make you famous in your circle and gain you more interested clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;You should also occasionally comment on the post of your customers or influencers, and post updates on your packages daily on your stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Make sure that you do not post too often, though, as that may be irritating for a lot of people and might lead to them unfollowing you.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The early steps of any venture can be terrifying but, trust us, following these simple suggestions, can help you attain a distinguished place in the online world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Social media plays a vital role in growing startups or already running a business. Targeting is also straightforward when you are using social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;All you need is strong determination and composure throughout this stage, and nothing will be out of your each. You will not only root your niche in the minds of people but do fantastic business. Good luck!</p>\r\n', '', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5de287c1d53fe.jpg', 2091, '2019-11-30 15:17:27'),

Going through flight rates, filling forms, booking hotels, is a very chaotic job, and that&rsquo;s precisely where Travel Agents could come in handy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Travel agents or one may call them life saviors, are people who handle your flight bookings, itinerary, hotel reservations, and technically your whole life before, and also while you&rsquo;re out there relaxing on your destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just provide them with your information, your preferences, and your demands, and you&rsquo;re good to go from there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, if your mind is muddled between online booking or whether to contact a Travel agent for the reservation. Worry not, for this article has a solution for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your decision will surely be made easy with the following points on why we think opting for a Travel Agent is much better than going for online booking:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"1\">\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h2>Travel Agents offers One-on-One attention</h2>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1575113906/godfather-4292451_640_yg6cw8.jpg\" />You can provide your travel destination, your suitable time, your preferred airline, etc. and they will give you the best of the options according to your preferences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their suggestions will be top-notch and purely based on what you demand. You will have your trip personalized. So, one-on-one attention and an honest opinion too? Why ever not?</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h2>They know what&rsquo;s new and buzzing</h2>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1575113907/new-years-eve-1953253_640_gxmiqf.jpg\" />Is Asia safe to travel to? Is the island open in so- so season? Are the prices on the peak this season?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When is the best time to visit Thailand? Travel agents know it all, the deep inner secrets, hacks, and all the useful information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, they know exactly what&rsquo;s up and what&rsquo;s hot in the hood. They&rsquo;ll make sure you make it in time for the New Year&rsquo;s fireworks in Dubai or to Coachella before the prices reach the skies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They&rsquo;ll save you time in researching so you don&rsquo;t end up landing in a country at the wrong time and end up with a vacation gone wrong!</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h2>No Internet Access required!</h2>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1575113906/webdesign-3411373_640_czekeh.jpg\" />With online bookings, you&rsquo;ll need to have internet access for booking and then, later on, keep track of it. There&rsquo;s no such requirement with Travel Agents!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It makes traveling easier for people from remote areas, too, where there is barely any internet connection available. But hey! TA&rsquo;s got your back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They&rsquo;ll be available anytime and anywhere and are just a phone call away.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h2>Stress and Hassle-free booking</h2>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1575113906/frog-1339892_640_gcciq7.jpg\" />Not many people can get the hold of filling out the forms, emailing, etc. when booking online. One wrong name entered, and you can mess up the whole thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They&rsquo;ll have your information and do their job most perfectly because they&rsquo;re much more used to doing it on a daily basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Travel agents are angels in disguise. They&rsquo;ll make the track of your flight and even let you know if your flight gets delayed or canceled or in case of any inconvenience.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"5\">\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h2>Time-saving for frequent Travelers</h2>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1575113906/time-2980690_640_pyqgvd.jpg\" />If you&rsquo;re a person who has to make commonplace business trips and you&rsquo;re always on the go and don&rsquo;t have a lot of time in hands for going online and make the booking all over again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The travel agent will genuinely be your savior, all you&rsquo;ll need to do is provide your personal information just once, and they&rsquo;ll have it confidentially saved for the next time.

Or that cheap thrift store in Turkey? They&rsquo;ll let you know, worry not!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to all of that, they&rsquo;ll also give you exclusive access to places where you cannot go if you go through Normal booking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since they earn their revenue from the hotels, airlines, etc., they&rsquo;re given exclusive access from various brands, hotels, etc</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"9\">\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h2>Insurance</h2>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/uhs/image/upload/v1575113906/calculator-385506_640_ya9hkn.jpg\" />One should know that things might not always go according to the plan.

You don&rsquo;t have to worry about making calls, standing in lines.

A right travel agent has a travel bug and is wanderlusts! They&rsquo;ll inspire you to visit destinations that you have never seen or even heard of while not being bulky in your pocket too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They&rsquo;re globally connected, so they know of every country and language, which cuts out our language barrier issue as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They come from different backgrounds. Most have traveled the whole world, lived, experienced the customs and traditions, met tons of people from different ethnicity. All in all, they&rsquo;re pretty cool people, and exciting to communicate with!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aaaand, they&rsquo;re helping you cut off a destination from your bucket list, so they are fantastic!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering the above-mentioned points, we all know what to do first when we&rsquo;re taking our next trip. Book a travel Agent!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A travel agent helps you anytime and guides you properly about the specific booking. Without a travel agent, you can find a lot of difficulties in your reservation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want ordinary, do it yourself. If you want magic, look to an experienced advisor. They know contacts who can make magic happen!</p>\r\n', '', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5de289357dc84.jpg', 3194, '2019-11-30 15:22:38'),

To build a long-term relationship with your customers, you need to provide them a great booking experience. Booking processes have become simpler, faster and more efficient. Guests can now book directly from your website, which allows you to take an organized approach to provide the best guest experience. Here, we will discuss about how to buy a booking engine for your travel agency in 2020 according to your requirements.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><br />\r\n<u><strong><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><em><span style=\"font-size:11.5pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">First thing first, what is a booking engine?</span></span></span></em></span></strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11.5pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">A booking engine is a software application that secures online reservations. To offer your customers the best service, you need to pick a booking engine which is user-friendly and professional. Below are some features you should care about when buying a booking engine. </span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><u><strong><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Integration with your Channel Manager</span></span></span></strong></u></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11.5pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Remember your website is only one of your digital channels. What important is that your booking engine integrates with your channel manager to avoid unavailable rooms being booked by oblivious and soon-to-be irked guests. This is a way to make sure that your room inventory across all of your online channels is updated constantly and that everyone is on the same page. </span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11.5pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\"><strong>PHPTRAVELS</strong> works with all major channel managers and provides integrations with a number of channel managers and PMS systems. </span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><u><strong><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Compatible with mobile and social media sites </span></span></span></strong></u></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11.5pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">According to researches, mobile now occupies the highest percentage of 60% of total website traffic across all clients. Mobile bookings are becoming more and more important in today&#39;s landscape. It is vital that your booking engine is compatible with different kinds of mobile so that your customers can do their bookings easily. This requires a responsive booking engine along with mobile reports and strategies. </span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><u><strong><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Flexible to your hotel&rsquo;s demands</span></span></span></strong></u></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11.5pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">One of the most important things is that your booking engine should meet your hotel&#39;s demands. To find out what exactly those demands are, think about what your guests need. First thing first, consider where your guests come from. Make sure the booking engine covers all the languages that they speak and currency that they pay with. Then consider if the booking engine provides online voucher sales. Just think about those needs carefully before picking a booking engine to make sure it gives your hotel the features it needs. </span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><u><strong><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Data collection </span></span></span></strong></u></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11.5pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Your booking engine should give you clear, in-depth insights into your hotel&#39;s performance. These insights should contain direct conversion rates, bookings via desktop and mobile, the average length of stay and profit from packages and promotions. Your booking engine should allow you to find interest and booking patterns that will help you increase your income and improve your marketing strategies. Moreover, a booking engine supplier will provide expert advice and improvement based on this data and best practices. </span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><u><strong><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Features that help you build guests relationship </span></span></span></strong></u></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11.5pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">The more your guests know about you, the more chances that they choose you again in the future. Personal relationships are important in motivating direct bookings and your booking engine should help you create and build these with e-mail communications. For example, your booking engine should allow you to send automated pre-stay emails with information about the guest&#39;s stay a few days before arrival. Another thing you should care about is that post-stay emails should be available and contain an invitation for guests to give feedback on their stay. </span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><u><strong><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Reasonable price</span></span></span></strong></u></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11.5pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Just like other things, when it comes to the booking engines, you should also set aside a certain budget. The fee you pay should contain many features such as integration with a PMS or a Channel Manager, mobile-responsiveness, connecting to payment providers, merchant services and so on. You need to find a platform that allows you to customize according to your specific demands and strategy. </span></span></span><strong><a href=\"https://phptravels.com/\" style=\"color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"font-size:11.5pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\">PHPTRAVELS</span></span></a></strong><span style=\"font-size:11.5pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\"><strong> </strong>can meet all your demands at affordable prices.

With these features, you can increase the website&#39;s profit potential. A booking engine should allow you to publish holiday-related or time-sensitive promotions. Strikethrough pricing options are also necessary, and let your potential customers know how much they&rsquo;re saving. </span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><u><strong><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Conclusion </span></span></span></strong></u></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11.5pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">In short, you should follow the list above to make sure you pick the perfect booking engine for your business.

Contributing even more to our ease are networks like GDS, Global Distribution Systems. Back in the 1960s, there were not many efficient ways to keep track and conduct business with organizations or people with geographical constraints. That is when it was felt that a more efficient method was required. The development and usage of global distribution systems started in the 1970s. That is when B2B commerce started between organizations and travel agencies felt that a better system was required for them to work effectively and fully serve their purpose.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">&nbsp;The global distribution system can be defined as a network that helps with the connectivity of different travel agencies to multiple different organizations such as hotels. It also greatly helps with making reservations and booking different flights according to the clients&rsquo; requirements. These systems allow the travel agencies to have access to hotel inventories that can greatly help them with making different bookings according to what the client is looking for. For example, Global distribution systems help the airline to keep track of the types of rooms available in different hotels, for example, the number of luxury rooms, suites and regular rooms available in hotels that are situated in different geographical locations. That is because Global Distribution Systems help the travel agencies with being updated with the latest information available about different hotels, airlines, and tours.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Global distribution systems have not only made the lives of travel agencies easier, but it has also helped them to capture more business and reaching out even more to their potential clients. Because of the multiple benefits that are offered by these systems, they are mostly used by travel agencies. These systems have greatly changed the way the travel agencies have started operating, that is because the factor of specificity has been included and the travel agencies know when, where and how to provide their services to a large pool of different clients at once. This also helps them save time. It has also helped to maximize the number of bookings of their clients which also indirectly helps the travel agencies to generate more revenues. These systems are not only beneficial to the travel agencies but also to the hotels. That is because it helps them to attract more customers. Hotels do that because of easy accessibility to the travel agencies. This also helps the hotels to generate more revenues, hence more profits. Another major advantage of using these systems in conducting business activities is that they do not require any lengthy contracts or any major formalities that need to be performed. They also help the travel agencies target extremely specific markets and tap unexplored markets if that is one of their aims or objectives.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Another major change the GDS has brought about in the word of travel agencies is that it helps them capture more corporate level clients and businessmen who are always on the go. That is because people generally find it hard to take care of bookings and their traveling schedules so they seek the help of travel agencies to do that. It is also thought to be easier for the client as they believe that they end up saving money by hiring a travel agency to do all the work for them.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">The benefits of using global distribution systems are never-ending, however, there is also some drawback that should be taken into consideration by the organizations employing these systems. The biggest drawback of using these systems is the initial cost. In the case of hotels and travel agencies, hotels usually pay and initial fees and then over a period of time, it pays the agent and the transaction fees depending on the bookings that are being done. The fees can be both high or low however it is important for hotels to make sure that their prices are not too high and that they are balanced rates considering the type of market in which they are operating. Good prices being set by hotels is the key to developing a good relationship with the travel agency. However, it is also important for the hotels to make sure that they don&rsquo;t set their prices too low in an attempt to capture or attract more customers because that will eventually negatively affect the profits being generated by the hotels to a great extent.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">There are three main types of global distributions systems</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Amadues GDS &ndash; This type of system is the market leader as it enjoys a good 40 percent of its market shares. It has been operating for more than 30 years in the world of global distribution systems, it operates in more than 190 markets and it has more than 17000 employees working for it. It has an extremely high level of access to the European markets and its headquarters are situated in Germany. This type of system is usually used by travel agencies to book flights.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Sabre GDS &ndash; This type of system is the closest competitor of Amadues GDS. It is mostly used by hotels as it caters to their requirements in aiding the hotels with making reservations and bookings. This system is used by more than 200,000 hotels and it not only helps with the reservations but it also provides multiple hotel tech solutions. Its database is located in US Texas.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Travelport GDS &ndash; This system has three main subdivisions; Apollo, Worldspam and Galileo. This system was developed in 1971 and it caters to very large and very diverse markets of Asia, The United States, and Europe. Along with the basic service, it also provides a variety of travel industry solutions. Galileo was developed for catering to the needs of hotels whereas Worldspam was developed specifically for airlines.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">An intermediary is required for the efficient functioning of a GDS. That means that a GDS provider, the intermediary, will provide the GDS system to the organization. The intermediary also has access to the property management system of the organization. For example, in the case of a hotel, the hotel will be able to manage all of its details for example its photos, rates, descriptions, room listings and the services that are offered. This is helpful because it leads to the efficient management of the inventory. As reservations are made, it shows that the inventory has reduced across all channels along with the official website of the hotel itself.</span><br />\r\n<br />\r\nLooking at your online solution to sell your GDS tickets or suppliers&#39; integration?&nbsp;<br />\r\ncontact us today at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://phptravels.com/\">https://phptravels.com/</a>&nbsp;and we will help you to integrate your GDS with your website and mobile apps.&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 'Global Distribution System, travel agencies, bookings, easy accessibility', 1, 6, 0, 'image_750x_5e32bf26a38a1.jpg', 3098, '2020-01-29 21:55:03'),

Not only the opportunities, connecting with other people in today&#39;s&nbsp;era is a very easy thing to do. With the internet and multiple social media platforms available, we can easily connect with others and share our lives with them without much hassle. Not only on a personal level, but this has helped businesses to expand and reach out to new people as well.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Instagram is a platform that is currently playing a major role in different business sectors. When we talk about a travel agency, Instagram can play a major role in helping to explore new customers and reach out to the untapped markets. The first and the most important thing that a travel agency must do is create an Instagram profile and make sure that it is public so that it is easy for people to visit that profile. Another thing that should be kept in mind is that people are only going to know more about your travel agency if you keep posting about it so it is essential to keep the masses updated. If we compare Instagram to other social media platforms, a very different feature of Instagram is that as we increase the number of hashtags under the posts, it is most likely to appear more often on other peoples&rsquo; profiles &ndash; that is a very effective technique that can be used to attract new client towards your travel agency.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">It is important to make sure that your Instagram profile is visually attractive so it is essential to post attractive pictures of different travel destinations to inspire people to travel more and hence, use the services provided by your travel agency. To make the pictures even more attractive and visually appealing, Instagram provides a wide range of filters that can be used to enhance the colors and the overall aesthetic of the picture. Along with uploading attractive pictures, it is important to write a good caption under it. The caption can include details of the location along with some interesting facts about its history and culture. This helps the reader to explore different perspectives of traveling. Moreover, it can also prove to be beneficial to add different locations on the posts, that way a company can make its position on the map.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">At the end of the day, all the effort that is being put into these posts will go into waste if there is no engagement from the client. People, these days, are always very excited to share their life updates with their loved ones through social media and people, generally, tend to post more when they are on vacation so a good way of seeking customer attention can be to hold a &lsquo;best picture competition&rsquo;. The followers of your account will upload different pictures and tag you under their posts. The person with the best image of a unique travel destination can be offered something as a reward. This will help to increase the level of participation and engagement of the people. The travel agency can also ask their clients to use hashtags under their posts and tag them.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">We are living in a world in which everything is digitized so it is important to keep up with the latest trends and do the marketing of your products or services through digital means. This can be done through the building and designing of digital brochures and pamphlets. People usually find bright colors and bold fonts to be very attractive and eye-catching so they can be used to make your digital advertisement visually attractive.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">The young generation of today is very well aware of all the digital platforms that are available to them. In fact, a study showed that 53 percent of our population of ages between 18 to 29 have their own Instagram accounts. So, it can prove to be beneficial for a travel agency to target today&#39;s&rsquo; youth and reach out to them. Not only because they have their own personal Instagram accounts, but today&#39;s&rsquo; youth is also very interested in traveling and exploring new places on Earth so targeting them specifically and marketing your product/service to them can prove to be extremely beneficial. It can also result in positive word of mouth of your company.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">There is a large number of bloggers and influencers on Instagram whom people trust. Travel agencies can also reach out to them for paid or unpaid collaborations. Usually, bloggers with a large number of following don&rsquo;t collaborate with brands unless they are paid but bloggers with a small following don&rsquo;t mind unpaid collaborations as they believe that they are still growing and any collaboration can help them in their journey of growth. Travel agencies can ask bloggers to post pictures of different tourist attractions and tag them under these posts. This can prove to be beneficial for the travel agency because people find it much easier to relate to the bloggers on a personal level and trust them rather than being convinced by the organization that is advertising its products/services itself. If a travel agency does not have enough budget for collaboration, then they can follow back their followers from their official Instagram account and share the pictures of their followers on their Instagram stories to show appreciation and recognition.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Despite such a positive role being played by Instagram to capture more clients, there is however a big barrier to this social media platform that can cause problems for travel agencies. That is, Instagram prioritizes only those posts which a person seems to be interested in and stops showing the posts that are not of the users&rsquo; interest. A good way to overcome is this problem can be to share all your posts on Facebook, as it is the parent company of Instagram, to increase the viewership of your content.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Considering the wide variety of social media platforms available, Instagram can prove to be the most efficient way of communicating and attracting new customers. That is because Instagram usage has drastically increased over the years as compared to other social media platforms, such as Facebook, which has made it even easier to approach the masses.</span></p>\r\n', '', 1, 6, 0, 'image_750x_5e3817febc642.jpg', 2077, '2020-02-03 12:52:38'),

(93, 1, 'The ultimate guide for selecting the best software suited for your online travel agency.', 'the-ultimate-guide-for-selecting-the-best-software-suited-for-your-online-travel-agency', '<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">In the past few decades, a lot of change has been experienced and observed in the world of travel agencies. In the previous decades, people used to do all the effort themselves whenever they wanted to go for a trip. That required days and days of endless research about different hotels, airlines, routes, etc. Not only did all of that research take up a lot of time but it also resulted in a lot of money being spent on unnecessary things. With a wide variety of travel agencies evolving over the decades, a lot of time and money of the people has been saved. The best part was that the travel agencies started taking care of all the worries of their clients and all that was left for them to worry about was to have a great vacation. A research that was conducted showed that by hiring a good travel agency that can efficiently cater to their needs, a person can save up to 452 dollars per trip, which is a lot of money for an average person who belongs to an upper middle class. Another study showed that 65 percent of people choose to make their bookings through a travel agency even if they believe online bookings to be cheaper as compared to the services provided by travel agencies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Along with the large variety of travel agencies available for us to pick from, there is also a very wide variety of software in the market with different price tags on them. These software help travel agencies by providing their services more effectively and efficiently. However, because of the large variety, it gets really difficult for travel agencies to analyze their requirements and select the correct software for themselves. The basic idea of having software within your travel agency should be that the software should be able to manage multiple different agreements at one time and it should provide the best possible solutions to the problems that may arise within a travel agency.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Choosing the correct software for your travel agency is a massive responsibility. That is because many different factors need to be taken under consideration such as where your travel agency is currently standing in the market, its long term and short term goals and objectives and most importantly, the budget that your travel agency wants to allocate towards the desired software. When we talk about the goals of your travel agency, it should be kept in mind all the possibilities of investment that might be offered to it in the future and the level of business growth that it might experience. We should also consider the type of market that they may want to cater to. For example, if a travel agency only caters to the needs of people who want to get their flights booked then they might be missing out on the large demand of clients who are looking for hotel reservations. The best thing, in that case, would be to get a software that caters to all the basic needs of a travel agency &ndash; that includes hotel reservations &ndash; but mainly focuses on flight bookings.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">People generally have the perception that the price tag on something is directly proportional to the quality that it may deliver, however, that is not always the case. If we talk about software, the most important thing that should be taken into consideration is the needs and requirements of the travel agency that software may or may not be able to fulfill. On the other hand, the best-suited software for your travel agency will also not come for free so thinking that getting software with a really low price tag would serve the purpose would not be necessarily correct as it may end up creating even more problems for your travel agency.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">There is a wide variety of software out there that are specifically designed for travel agencies. If a travel agency is looking for a software that specifically revolves around booking and reservations, some of the good examples may include </span></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Lemax</span></strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Dolphin</span></strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Bookinglayer</span></strong></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.phptravels.com\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">PHPTRAVELS</span></strong></a></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">These&nbsp;softwares provide&nbsp;some really interesting features like an automatic billing system, GDS connectivity, adding custom discounts and offers, online booking confirmations and much more. This software also supports multiple currencies that can help create new customers in different parts of the world and each client has its portal. They are also good at keeping all the information updated for the convenience of the client.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">For a travel agency that needs software to fulfill their accounting needs, they may want to consider Xero, TravelWorks, and OnlineInvoices as their options. This software is great with generating online invoices, managing and keeping track of the inventory, connecting to different banks and reconciling with them. They also help to keep all the data secure within an organization and help analyze the sales. Some other features of this software can include keeping track of the sales commission of each of the travel agents and the levels of employee performance.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">For tour building, Tripcreator, Tourwriter, and Orioly are really good options as they keep all the confirmations and keep all the insights and reports updated. Lastly, managing the customer relationships within an organization is also very important and some softwares are specifically designed for serving that purpose as well. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">These software include </span></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li style=\"margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">Zoho Travels Agency CRM</span></strong></li>\r\n	<li style=\"margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">LeadSquared Travel CRM</span></strong></li>\r\n	<li style=\"margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">Kapture Travel CRM</span></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">This software provides features like customization of dashboards, creating travel-specific categories for the customers, supporting different marketing channels and creating an integrated set of marketing tools.</span></p>\r\n', 'travel software guide, best travel agencies software, booking software, booking engine suggestions , The ultimate guide for selecting the best software suited for your online travel agency.', 1, 6, 0, 'image_750x_5e3c00f0eea5c.jpg', 1923, '2020-02-06 12:02:54'),
(94, 1, 'How to boost your travel agency with vlogging.', 'how-to-boost-your-travel-agency-with-vlogging', '<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Living in a digitized world, we often come across different concepts like blogs and vlogs. Vlogging is an activity in which a person keeps a record of their daily life by making different videos. These videos can be both short or long depending on the interests of the vlogger and the type of content he or she likes to create and share. After these videos have been successfully made and edited, they are usually uploaded on a social media platform, for example, Instagram, Facebook or YouTube that is kept public for others to view. Vloggers usually tend to set a particular theme of the videos that they make and it is really important to set that particular theme because it sets the entire tone for the video but most importantly, it differentiates that one vlogger from so many other vloggers out there. Some of the examples of these themes include food, fashion, makeup, lifestyle, social issues, education, and travel. Making travel-related vlogs can sometimes turn out to be a really big challenge for the vloggers because as compared to food or maybe lifestyle, a travel vlogger has to make sure that he or she is not restricted to one particular geographical area. After all, making travel vlogs is all about exploring new destinations and keeping your viewers updated and entertained. Travel vlogs can also sometimes result in the vlogger being emotionally, physically and financially exhausted because the vlogger is always on the go. However, travel vlogs can help different travel agencies generate more business.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">The vlogging industry is getting bigger day by day and people generally believe bloggers and vloggers because they believe that they are authentic and the fact that what they are saying is the truth. Since people tend to rely upon what these vloggers say, they end up making their decisions on the experience of the vlogger. People tend to watch travel vlogs because they want to hear real-life stories of the vlogger, they want to know about the reviews of different travel destinations, they want to learn about different experiences of the vlogger or they want to get a general idea of that particular travel destination before actually visiting the place themselves. This also helps the vlogger in growing their page because they end up getting a greater number of likes, comments, shares, and subscriptions. A study conducted recently showed that travel vlogs get four more times the engagement as compared to a regular vlog. Another study that was conducted showed that 48 percent of the people who are looking for different travel destinations get their ideas through Instagram posts and 52 percent of them get their ideas from Facebook posts that are shared by their friends. This is a positive thing for the travel agencies because more the people want to travel, the more they will reach out to travel agencies to finalize their trip and take care of all the little things like flights, bookings and hotel reservations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Travel vlogs can be further classified for example some vloggers make videos about different exotic regions of the world, for example, Egypt, some vloggers may make videos about the hustle and bustle, and the busy lifestyle of all the big cities of the world, for example, New York or Lahore. Further categories can include making videos about different cultures and exploring new cuisines, for example, going for a wine tasting in Italy or making videos about experiencing risky adventures, for example, going for sky diving. These sub-categories help the viewer to make a better decision when planning out their trip.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">The high-quality videos made by the travel vloggers usually highlight different cultures, histories, fashions, and trends over the globe, they also help a person decide which hotel they want to stay in or which airline they want to book for their flights. After such decisions have been made and the customer decides to reach out to a travel agency, it may eventually help in creating positive word of mouth for the travel agency itself as the customer will be satisfied with their trip as he/she knew exactly what they wanted from their trip. This also helps create a massive advantage for the travel agency to plan the trip for their client exactly the way they want which can help to avoid all those little things that can potentially create inconveniences for their customers.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Sometimes travel agencies collaborate with different vloggers. That helps them to indirectly advertise their travel agency through that vlogger. For example, if a vlogger posts an interesting video on YouTube about a particular travel destination and at the end of the video talks a little about the travel agency and puts up their logo, all the people who will view that video will consider availing the services being offered by that particular travel agency. This can help the travel agency with getting more clients and creating healthy, long term relationship with them. This can also help the travel agency to create more brand awareness in the market about themselves and help it to explore new untapped markets and attract potential customers.

All that is left for us to do is to make the payment and make sure that we enjoy our trip. Hiring a travel agent also leads to some extra money and effort being saved as they know exactly what their client needs and that helps them to come up with the most convenient package for the client. Travel agencies make our lives easier and it seems to us that it is really easy for them to make money from us as their clients. This is not always true because like any other business, sometimes travel agencies can also have trouble with expanding their business in terms of sales, the number of customers and in terms of geographical regions. Some major factors travel agencies need to take into consideration that can help them in boosting and growing their business as a whole.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">First and foremost, every business should know what it is competing against. For a travel agency, it is important to keep track of all the competing travel agencies in the market, the services they are providing, their market share and the prices that they are offering to their clients. Knowing all of this information can help a travel agency to come up with different strategies that can help, if not beat its competition, then to at least come up to its level. It&rsquo;s also important that you know the area in which your travel agency specializes. This way more effort can be put into that specific area of your travel agency which can help to make the services even better. Almost every travel agency can perform the basic tasks for their clients like booking flights and making hotel reservations but having a special quality or a skill which you are good at can give you an edge over your competition.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Another technique that can help your travel agency to expand and grow can be by giving it a personal touch and personalizing some of the services that you are providing to your customers. It is important to make sure that you are in constant contact with your customers and that you happily answer all their questions, queries and concerns in a positive manner. Make sure that all the calls and emails are being answered timely. This helps the customer to think that they are in good hands and that the money that they are paying for the services is not being wasted. Another plus point of good communication can be the positive word of mouth for the travel agency which can be extremely beneficial in the long run. This will also gradually build up the customers&#39; confidence and increase the level of customer loyalty as they will always come to you whenever they feel the need of availing your services.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">The way you market the services or the products that you are offering also makes a big difference in the level of growth or expansion that your company might experience. Nowadays, everything can be done on the internet which can be of massive advantage to the travel agencies if used correctly. It is important that the correct platforms are being used to attract the correct kind of clients for your travel agency. These days, Instagram and Facebook are two of the social media platforms that are being widely used to promote and advertise different products and services that are being offered by different organizations. Such social media platforms can also be used by travel agencies for their benefit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">No matter what it takes, it is important to keep the standard and the quality of the services being provided by the travel agency high. This is important because no matter how much you charge your clients, people are only going to return to you to avail your services again if they have had a good experience during the first time. It is also important to make sure that only those people, representing the travel agency, are in direct contact with the customer who is good at negotiation. That is because at the end of the day all of your efforts will go to waste if you are unable to convince your potential customer to avail of your services.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">When it comes to expanding your travel agency geographically, the best and the most effective way of doing that would be to increase the number of people who represent your travel agency and make sure that they are scattered in different geographical areas and not concentrated in one particular area. That way, your representatives in different geographical locations will have someone to offer the services of the travel agency on a personal level. Another effective way of geographical expansion can be opening different offices in areas where there is high demand so that people can come and personally visit your office. This will also create a positive impression of your organization on the client as the client will be able to physically see where all the work is done.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">In a world that is constantly changing in one way or another, there is an endless number of possibilities that one could explore and avail. As a travel agent, it is important to make sure that you are updated with all the needs of your current and potential customers. Not only that it is also important to come up with new and innovative ways to meet the expectations of your customers in a way that is not too expensive for the travel agency and the customer is satisfied as well. A good way of doing that would be to hire new and experienced resources that are well aware of the latest opportunities and threats in the market. Along with new resources, the latest technology can also be hired to find out about what is going on in the market and those changes can be used in your benefit &ndash; to grow and expand your travel agency.</span></p>\r\n', 'easy travel agency, different hotel reservation, booking hotel easy, easy booking hotel, easy agency, easy travel', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5e57952ee1ea8.jpg', 1293, '2020-02-27 12:21:57'),
(96, 1, 'Why is it important to keep your travel agency multilingual and multi-currency', 'why-is-it-important-to-keep-your-travel-agency-multilingual-and-multi-currency', '<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">There are approximately 6500 languages in this world and many more speakers of those languages. When we talk about currencies, there are currently 164 different currencies that are being used all over the world. Having a business that offers its services in multiple different languages in exchange for many different currencies means that your business will be able to capture a lot more people who speak different languages and use multiple currencies in different parts of the world. One of the biggest barriers of communication is the language barrier and overcoming this hurdle means that you may be able to generate a lot more business and attract a lot more customers.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Operating a travel agency that can provide their services in different languages can have a great impact on your customer service and can help you generate a lot more revenue. Being able to read and comprehend things clearly can have a big impact on the customers&rsquo; decision before making a purchase, the same is the case with travel agencies. A study showed that there are more chances for a customer to purchase your product or avail the service being offered if the information provided on your website is in their native language. Easy comprehension is not the only benefit that comes with a multilingual company, another major advantage is that your client finds it easier to trust your company and is easily convinced that your company is legitimate and is a credible source for information. Moreover, the need for multilingual online booking engines has been on a rise over the past few decades so having a multilingual website can help cater to that particular need as well as helping in generating more business for the travel agency. Google translate can be of help to a certain extent but there is no comparison between a machine-translated website and a website that has been optimized from the very beginning.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">In the beginning, the idea of developing a multilingual website can be a little hard to comprehend since there are approximately 6500 languages. Because of the large variety of languages, it can be a little intimidating when deciding on which language to chose and which not to prioritize. An easy way to make that decision can be to use different tools and software are to find out where most of your clients are coming from. Then, according to those different regions and areas, more languages can be incorporated into your website. Having a multilingual website is extremely important for those travel agencies that market their services on an international level. That is because if your website is multilingual, it will most likely appear at the top when multilingual travel agencies are searched on different search engines which will automatically boost the traffic on your website as it will be of service to more people.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Having a multilingual website without options of different currencies won&rsquo;t be of much use. For example, if your search engine has the options of Hindi, Urdu, and English as languages but the transactions can only be made in US dollar, then you are likely to lose clients who speak Hindi or Urdu as they won&rsquo;t have a model through which they can make a payment. So, your clients must have the option of making a payment through the currency of that particular area of which language is being used. A big advantage of operating a multi-currency website is the convenience of your client. It is really important to make things easy and understandable for your client. That way, whenever your client feels the need to avail of the services of a travel agency, they will automatically feel inclined towards your agency. This will, eventually, increase customer loyalty as being transparent about your rates and prices is the key to more loyal customers.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Having a multi-currency website means that your travel agency can easily attract more customers from international markets. This can help your travel agency to explore many different markets and gain more business. As a result, this can lead to higher levels of profitability of your travel agency both in the short and long run. People also appreciate consistency in the prices that are mentioned. Consistency in prices makes the client feel as if they are saving money by availing your services rather than going for a travel agency that only offers payment through one currency. Having a multi-currency travel agency also means that your customer will have more options when it comes to making the payment which results in further convenience for the customer. People also feel that by making the payment in a different currency, they are availing the same benefit for a lower cost as compared to making a payment in their currency.</span></p>\r\n', 'travel agency multi language, travel agency multi currency, multi language and current travel agency, multiple languages and currencies travel company', 1, 6, 0, 'image_750x_5e551e6d51b06.jpg', 1237, '2020-02-25 12:23:16');

The technology around us is taking new twists and turns almost every other day leaving a great impact on our lives and leaving us baffled. Earlier, what was considered impossible is now very common in our lives. Not only have all the technological advancements made an impact on our lives, but it has also made a massive impact on the tourism industry in a positive way. Technology has done some pretty amazing stuff in the past few years and has made the life of travel agents extremely easy. From surveying and planning your trip to booking, traveling and experiencing, technology has made all of it easy for us to do. According to one of the studies conducted, it has been observed that more than 50 million people traveled in 2015 as compared to 2014. This drastic increase over just a year is because of the technological advancements and the ease that it has resulted.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">One of the biggest advantages of all these technological advancements around us that we, as consumers, can look up for anything that we want thanks to the wide internet availability. All sorts of information are readily available for us and we can attain the knowledge of anything in a matter of just a few seconds. Because of this, it can be said that information technology is what is holding the tourism business in its place. Because of so much information available around us, the levels of awareness in people have increased. Nowadays, people are more informed about the latest tourist destinations and different places on earth that are attractive for people who love to travel and are adventurous. Because of this, the demand for travel agencies has also increased hence increasing the amounts of average annual revenue generated for the travel agencies by large numbers.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Another thing that has made the process of decision making easier consumers is the invention of smartphones. Nowadays, people think of their smartphones as their best friend, they always have their smartphones with them which means that they can easily access any sort of information that they desire. People tend to feel incomplete if they don&rsquo;t have their phones with them. Because of such great attachment to a device that can readily inform you with anything, the task of planning out different vacations and coordinating with their travel agents has been made a lot easier for the people. Smartphones have another major advantage because of which they are often not given enough credit for making our lives easier, which is the ease in communicating efficiently and effectively with multiple people at the same time.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Because of the large variety of online travel portals and online travel agencies, it is a lot easier for people to decide which portal or agency is the best suited for their needs and requirements, as it has been famously quoted, &lsquo;time is money&rsquo;. Because of the high level of engagement on multiple different social media platforms, the decision-making process of the consumer has been made even easier. That is because people can use different social media platforms such as Instagram or Facebook the acknowledge themselves about the different experiences of people with different travel agencies. This can help them to make their final decision as to which travel agency they should approach based on the reviews that they read online. Along with customers, travel agencies can also benefit from these social media platforms. These social media platforms can be used by travel agencies to approach new/potential customers by placing their advertisements on these platforms. These platforms are not only beneficial when a travel agency is attempting to capture new customers, but they can also be used to help rotate a positive image of the travel agency.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Technology can also help in rapid communication between the client and the travel agency. For example, if there is a sudden change of plans from the consumer&#39;s side, he can easily communicate with his travel agent about those changes without having to go through any major inconveniences. This is also an advantage for the travel agency, for example, if there is any problem with booking the flights, making the hotel reservations or planning out the tours, the travel agency can easily communicate to their client about these inconveniences and provide them with other alternative solutions that suit the client. The advancements in technology have also helped the travel agencies to develop a healthier relationship with their stakeholders such as different people operating at different levels within their business network, mainly because of better communication.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Technological advancements have also made things easier for hotels. Check-ins and check-outs can be done in a matter of a few seconds without having the customer go through any major inconvenience and ruining their experience for them. Different travel agencies and hotels have installed multiple different software that helps them in attaining their main goal and purpose. Not only are these software&rsquo; easy to use, but they are also extremely accurate and have extremely high speed. Some software does have a big price tag on them but, if we consider the long run, they are a good investment. This software can store all sorts of information; hotel staff, housekeeping, preferences of the guests, levels of inventories, details about the reservations, details about the flights and much more. Having so much information stored that can be made available to a person in a matter of seconds has made the lives of the people working in the tourism sector and the lives of the clients much easier.</span></p>\r\n', 'travel technology,  travel agency, travel industry, travel boosting industry', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5e515a68c528b.jpg', 1365, '2020-02-22 12:29:40'),

It can help your business expand and grow into many different directions that can eventually lead to more profitability. Starting an online version of your travel agency can be a lot easier if you compare it to opening and establishing a physical travel agency. The main reason for that can be that you do not have to look for an actual physical place where you can develop a working environment for yourself and your employees, everything can be done from your computers while remaining in your very own comfort zone. This can also help to save up some extra expenses and useful resources that can be invested in your travel agency. Working with an online travel agency can also be a lot easier for your stakeholders as they would not have to physically meet you every single time, this can help to save up some time as well.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Because of the constantly increasing levels of demand for good and well-experienced travel agents, it will be very easy to develop an online version of your travel agency and generate demand for the services that you are offering. However, there are a few factors that need to be kept in mind when you are planning on marking an online presence through your travel agency. The first and the most important factor that should be taken into consideration when opening an online version of an organization is the level of pre-planning that you require. You need to plan out every tiny detail about your travel agency so that you can avoid facing any problems later on. Factors like different categories available on your website or the basic outlook of your website can be some of the examples of the details that you need to take care of. You also need to think about the cut-throat competition in the tourism market so that you can come up with different strategies that can help you run the online version of your travel agency successfully. The best way to deal with high levels of competition in the market is to come up with a very straight forward strategy that is also realistic. You also need to make the advancements in the online world step-by-step and not rush into things all at once.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">It is also important to know your audience and target market well. You should have all the knowledge about the people you are trying to attract for your online travel agency. To attract them and gain their trust, you should make sure that your travel agency has some of the qualities that can help you stand out from your competition. A major advantage for you can be that you have an online as well as a physical travel agency, that way your customer will have the option of choosing whichever one he/she is more comfortable with. One of the best ways to know your target audience is by interacting and communicating with people. The more you know about what people want or what troubles them, the better you will be able to provide your services. For example, knowing the past experiences of your potential customers with other travel agencies can help you understand them a little better and know more about their likes and dislikes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Using a host agency for your online travel agency can also be another intelligent decision that you make. Not only will it help you take care of your online travel agency, but it will also help you to cut some of the costs that you may have to encounter. You should also provide your customers with the option of giving in their recommendations or sharing their points of view. This way, you will know what your customers are looking forward to and it will also help you to come up with and generate some creative ideas to make the online version of your travel agency even more attractive. For example, you may get different ideas about the latest tourist attractions and different destinations or maybe the best hotels in different areas. It can also help you to understand the budget of your clients even better and how to accommodate them within their limited budget in a way that does not compromise on your profits.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">You must allocate a specific budget that needs to be used in your online travel agency. You can not keep your budget unlimited or make such a tight budget that it gets harder for you to develop your online travel agency. Hiring employees specifically for catering to the needs of your online travel agency can be a very intelligent way of making your life easier. In some areas, some legal formalities need to be fulfilled before you set up an online travel agency so, to avoid any possible constraints in the future, it is in the best interest of the organization to take care of those formalities in the very beginning.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">If all of these factors are taken into consideration, transferring your physical travel agency into an online one can be made very easy for you and running them both can not be very difficult after all.</span></p>\r\n', 'online travel agency, existing travel agency to online agency, online travel agency and physical agency, travel agency, ota ', 1, 6, 0, 'image_750x_5e4d30d1d1ee8.jpg', 1612, '2020-02-20 12:31:21'),

Having a physical travel agency has both its advantages and disadvantages just like having an online travel agency would have. But the best way to weigh out the disadvantages of having a physical or an online travel agency would be to have both versions of your travel agency and operate them simultaneously operate them in different ways that are both effective and efficient.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">First and foremost, it is extremely important to make sure that the theme of your online travel agency and that of your physical travel agency are in alignment. Generally, people do not talk much about this but the minor details end up making a big difference at the end of the day, this is not only true for online and physical travel agencies but it is also true for any other organization that has a physical as well as a virtual platform where people can visit, interact, make payments, purchase different product or avail different services that are being offered to them. Having that said, minor things like the color scheme, font, type of content, number of options available for the customer, level of interactivity with the employee and modes of payment matter. All of these things should be the same throughout your brand, both in its physical self and its virtual self. For example, if the theme of your website is in the colors blue and white then the theme of your office should also be blue and white. Another example can be that if you only accept advance payments on your online travel agency then you should only accept advance payment system if a client visits you at your physical agency and inquires about different modes of payment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Another thing that is extremely important to keep in mind is that whatever information that you are porting on your online website, it should be one hundred percent genuine and authentic. The main reason for that is because when a random person scrolling through the internet visits your website, there is a probability that that person can be your potential client from whom you can generate some business if not a great deal of it. So whatever impression your travel agency will make on that particular person will be through the online version of your travel agency so it is important to make sure that all the information that is being provided on your online travel agency in the original. It is also important to provide some background about your travel agency. The background can include things like how well established you are, when was your company founded, who is the founder of your company, the number of employees working at your travel agency, the services you provide, if your prices and packages are negotiable or not, the current market share that your company currently enjoys, what sets you apart or makes you unique as compared to the competing travel agencies, so on and so forth. The main reason for this is that the person gets the impression that you are a well-established brand and is inclined towards availing your service. This is important because if a client visits you in a physical environment, you will be able to provide him/her with all of that information but when you have an online version of your travel agency, this information must be conveyed to the person in one way or another.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Other than that, someone should always be there to answer any questions or queries that an online visitor might have. That is because when a client visits you personally to avail your service, you will be able to answer all of their questions there and then but if the same questions are not answered online then the person might feel that they should look for other online travel agencies who can help them out. Another key factor in successfully running parallel a physical travel agency and an online version of it is to invest an equal amount of time and money on both of it or prioritize one over the other based on its need. However, it is also important to keep in mind that the division of your time and money should be done in such a way that neither of them is neglected and both the versions of your travel agency help you generate more business and hence generate more revenues, eventually. It is also important to make sure that you are well aware of the firms that are competing against you, firms that are more successful than you and are trying to form a monopoly or firms that are just entering the market. That way you can come up with different strategies that can help your travel agency deal with that competition in both the online and the physical world.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">To further make your life easier, you can install special software that can cater to the specific needs of your physical travel agency and the needs of the online version of your travel agency. This way, a lot of time and extra effort will be saved. Another thing that can be done is to hire more employees and make special teams for both the physical and the online travel agency so both of them get the appropriate amount of time and attention and keep on operating successfully.</span></p>\r\n', '', 1, 6, 0, 'image_750x_5e4bcb037efb4.jpg', 1312, '2020-02-19 12:31:45'),

The large organizations and businesses and travel agencies have experienced a lot of growth and enjoyed a lot of popularity in the last few years thanks to all the technological advancements. Not only for the businesses that have already established themselves over the years, but the businesses and the organizations that are new in different markets also have a great advantage of existing in an era in which everything is technology dependent and everything can be done in a matter of a few clicks. Not only for the businesses, the speed, efficiency and the effectiveness of communications between the clients and the organization has created a lot of conveniences for the businesses as well as the clients. Because of the technology, the number of human errors has also substantially reduced increasing the quality of the service or a product being provided by a certain organization. Not only has technology helped other businesses but it has also helped the travel industries to completely change the landscape of the tourism industry and has helped them create a more customer-centric approach when conducting business, which has proved to be extremely beneficial. Because of the ease that has been resulted by the advancements in technology, the barriers to entry for new businesses and the different barriers of communication between those businesses and the clients are pretty much gone.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">One of the biggest advantages that we enjoy because of the technological advancements around us is the increased level of personalization in almost everything. With the latest technologies like cloud computing and big data around us, different travel agencies can add a very personalized touch to the way they operate thanks to these technologies. This also gives them an edge over other competing travel agencies in the market. Not only that, but it also helps the client to customize the service that they want to avail based on their likes and dislikes. This can also help the travel agencies to gather new ideas and be innovative in the way they conduct business. By doing this, not only is the client happy but it also helps the travel agency to gather all the additional information about their client that can help the travel agency to come up with a more suited package for their client along with many different offers in the future.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">People in today&#39;s day depend on reviews or what others think of a particular product or a service. The same is the case when people want to hire a travel agency to help them plan out a trip or a vacation for them. For example, a person might visit different travel blogs on Instagram, Facebook or Twitter to find out the latest tourist attractions and the places that people are visiting these days the most. They might also want to look up about the different hotels that they might want to stay in or the different hotels that they might want to try when they are on vacation. Not only the hotels and the restaurants but today&#39;s traveler will also look for the best airlines with nominal rates that are most suited to their budget and the best routes to their destination. Not only for the traveler himself, but the power of social media has also transformed the way travel agencies and other businesses operate. In today&#39;s world, it is extremely important to mark your presence in the online world through the different social media platforms that are available to us. Because of these social media platforms, travel agencies can make the online pages that help them to advertise their services to the people out there. These pages can also help them to get different reviews about how they are currently performing and what can be done to improve their services. Most importantly, these social media platforms are a great way to advertise your travel agency as there is an unlimited amount of viewership.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Another major advantage of technology that has been observed is the increased level of constant connectivity and mobility. These days people have their phone with them all the time, which means that they are constantly connected to the travel agency so that the traveler can keep the travel agency update about their requirements. This has also resulted in convenience and ease for the travel agency itself as it can also keep its clients constantly updated with the latest services and offers, moreover, if there is some sort of change in any one of the tours planned by that particular agency, the travel agency can instantly inform its client about that inconvenience and can provide it with other more suitable options for them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLooking to start your own travel portal?&nbsp;<br />\r\nCheck out our main site </span><a href=\"https://phptravels.com/\">https://phptravels.com/</a>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size:11pt\">and let us help you to build your online travel portal&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n', 'travel technology, travel agencies innovation, travel agencies decades', 1, 6, 0, 'image_750x_5e49aa35d4063.jpg', 1428, '2020-02-18 12:32:17'),

There are new travel agencies that are evolving day by day so it is extremely important that every step you take is extremely intelligent and helps your travel agency to beat the competition that it might face. With the large variety of travel agencies in the market, people have a wide variety to choose from. Your potential customer is not confined to use the services that are only provided by your travel agency, they can look around and pick whichever travel agency that they think is the best suited for their needs. This means that the customer has the negotiation power as whichever travel agency he or she picks would certainly not like to lose their customer to their competition. Travel agencies usually only focus on keeping their current clients happy and satisfied, hence loyal to them. However, in the process of doing that, they sometimes forget that other objectives need to be met as well, for example attracting new travelers. Having such a high level of competition in the market, it is extremely important to make sure that you make wise decisions that can only result in providing your travel agency an edge over its competition.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">One of the most effective technique that can be implemented to keep your customers loyal to your travel agency, increase the number of sales and revenues and build up a positive reputation for your travel agency can be highlighting the main benefits of availing the services being offered by your travel agency as compared to those that are being offered by your competitors. Instead of just focusing on beating up your competition, you can ask the satisfied customers to review your services that they once availed. This does not only help you in creating a positive image for your brand but it will also help you to attract more customers, as people tend to trust personal reviews more than actual advertisements from the brand itself. You can post those reviews on your official website for the public to view, this can also indirectly advertise your travel agency.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Another important thing that can positively contribute to the success of your travel agency is the level of your interactions with your customers. A high level of interactions with your customers will portray a message on them that you are concerned about what you are providing them with. This will also help to get your customers to trust you with the decisions that you make for them. Not only that, as a travel agency you will also learn a lot more by being interactive with your customers, for example, their likes and likes, what their demand is or what they expect from you as a travel agency. You can use questionnaires, images, and videos to help you to be more interactive with your customers.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Another thing that can help your travel agency to stand out in the market is to install the latest technology. This might mean that you have to install an online software that is best suited for your needs. Getting software for your travel agency may sound intimidating at first as they do tend to have a big price tag on them, however, if the returns on this investment are thought of in the long run then it is a smart thing to do. The software will not only make things faster in your travel agency, but it will also help you to store all the important data related to your customer that can be used later. Furthermore, depending on the type of software that you install, it can also help you with the bookings and the reservations. Having the latest technology within your organization can be of great advantage to you as a travel agency as everything at your organization is being done in a lot faster and efficient way.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Extending your B2B connections is another way of dealing with competition. Having good relationships with your partners means that they can help you to get into a new market and acquire new customers. This can also help you to learn a lot more about the demands of travelers and what they want along with what is new in the tourism industry.</span></p>\r\n', 'Different ways for travel agencies, different travel agencies, travel agencies, new travel agencies', 1, 6, 0, 'image_750x_5e44373da15ab.jpg', 1547, '2020-02-06 12:33:06'),

When relating to travel development, APIs are used to showcase another travel company&rsquo;s inventory on your site, so that visitors can browse directly on the website and the deals can show in conjunction with other deals from other travel companies to create a comparison search engine.

(103, 1, 'The present and future of travel agencies around the globe.', 'the-present-and-future-of-travel-agencies-around-the-globe', '<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">The travel industry has seen many changes over the decades and even more, changes are expected to be seen in the coming future. Multiple different factors are contributing to this constantly changing world of the travel industry, for example, the increased levels of awareness amongst people and the technological advances being experienced. Not only the travel industry in different parts of the world has experienced a positive change, but they have also had to face many hurdles and difficulties because of the facilities being provided by Uber, Airbnb, Skyscanner, etc. These three platforms have completely transformed and dismantled the way we view traveling in general and have also disrupted some of the profound changes that were observed in the travel industries in previous years. The increased levels of demand for online travel agencies have been quite obvious over the years. Online travel agencies have completely taken over the tasks of booking tickets and making hotel reservations which were once the responsibilities of the virtual travel agencies. Yes, virtual travel industries are still there but the constantly growing market of online travel agencies is slowly and gradually taking over them.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">A very big part of the revenues and the profits that are being generated in the travel agency comes from the commissions that the travel agents earn through providing their services that are being demanded by the customers but the way those commissions are earned today has changed greatly if we compare it to the way they were earned, let us say, ten years ago. There was a phase in the 1990s when the travel agencies stopped paying commissions to their agents, back then a lot of extra services were started to be provided and a lot of value was also added in those services to earn more. Just like the 1990s, service providers like Uber and Airbnb have gradually started to take over the commissions being earned by the agents. Even though these service providers are gradually taking over the commissions being earned by private travel agents, this, however, is still not a very big problem. That is because along with the increase in the offerings of these service providers, travel agencies have also started coming up with different ways to up their game in the world of the travel industry for example by offering different types of holiday packages. The travel agencies have come up with different ways to keep u with the constantly growing markets however to secure a bright future, travel agencies must be innovative and are successful in capturing the attention of their target audience.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">One of the smartest ways to keep that captured interest within your organization is to add value to whatever you are offering to your client. The best way to add value to the services being provided by your organization is to focus on the tiny details, for example, the level of ease and comfort you can create for your clients when they are traveling. Things that can create ease and comfort for your client can include things like the type of hotels you get booked, the internet connectivity of that particular country, finding the appropriate traveling season for your client and currency exchange. Your client may not focus on these tiny details in the beginning but in case they end up facing any inconvenience in their trip, they might end up blaming you. That is why it is important to keep these things in mind, which will also help you to create more value for your services. Another way of adding value to your services can be to make useful recommendations to your client, for example, an attractive tourist destination that your client might be interested in.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">When we talk about the growth and the future of the world of travel industries, it can be said that the travel industry has the potential to do wonders in different areas of interest however those wonders are not being observed by the naked eye. A reason for that is that with the high levels of unpredictability, travel agencies prefer to keep things old fashioned and they prefer to keep functioning the way they have been. They are generally scared of taking new risks which results in them missing out on the opportunities as well. Another very important thing that should be kept in mind is the constantly increasing technological advances. Different travel agencies all over the globe have started using those technologies within their organizations and have started exploring new concepts. This has not only made the lives of the travel agents easier but also the lives of their respective clients as there are lesser complications involved and there is a lesser chance of things going wrong. If the travel agencies continue to make use of technology productively then it can confidently be said that the world of travel is bound to bloom in the future.</span></p>\r\n', 'future of travel agencies, travel agencies,  travel future, travel business', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5f91754fc28d8.jpg', 797, '2020-10-22 16:26:35');

What travel agencies tend to forget is the constantly increasing levels of business in the industry. With such high levels of business, it can sometimes be hard for you to expand as an organization and you also may end up taking the wrong steps to make your organization grow. It is extremely unfortunate for a travel agency to end up losing focus of who they are in an attempt to expand an organization. This article provides some helpful tips that can be used by travel agencies to stay in focus.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">First and foremost, it is extremely important to make sure that the spotlight is on your travel agency as compared to it being on your competitors. To do that, you should highlight the benefits that your clients will gain if they choose to avail of the services being provided by you as compared to your competitors. A good way of doing that could be by highlighting and pointing out your strengths to your target market rather than focusing on dealing with the ever-growing competition. You can also ask some of your loyal customers to review the services they availed from your travel agency and to post them on their social media accounts along with mentioning the name of your organization. This could help you to attract more potential customers.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">It is important to make your customers feel as if they are being heard and you acknowledge the fact that they have chosen your travel agency as compared to your competitors. To do that, you must interact with your customers and make sure that you develop a healthy relationship with them. We are currently living in the world in which having a presence on social media is considered to be important so different social media platforms, for example, Instagram and Facebook can be used to have interactive sessions with your customers. This will show your potential clients that your organization realizes what the customers want and are striving towards fulfilling that demand.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Instead of just trying to sell the services that you offer, your organization should aim towards providing a joyful experience that stays in the memory of your clients. Instead of just fulfilling what your customer demands from you, a better idea would be to also make different recommendations according to the nature of your customer and their preferences. For example, if a customer is into adventure, then you can recommend some of the unique destinations where they could fulfill their need of doing something adventurous and something fun. Not only will this satisfy your customer, but it will also be helpful for you to generate more revenues that way.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Instead of offering individual services, you can come up with different and interesting packages for your clients. For example, if your client wants you to make reservations and booking for them, instead of just doing what you can come up with a unique package that involves multiple services such as other activities along with the hotel reservations and the flight bookings. This way your client will get to avail a lot more of your services and they will feel as if they are getting more out of what they are being charged for, in easy words, they will feel as if they are saving money by availing services from you rather than availing them from other travel agencies that are competing against you.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Another important factor that it is taken into consideration can help your business grow is by finding a niche market. Finding a niche market for your organization to target does not necessarily mean that you are targeting a small group of people, it means that the services that you are offering to your target market are very unique as compared to your competition. This will not only set you apart but it will also help you to develop more customer loyalty. </span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">These days, time is money and one can not simply waste their time on small tasks such as finding out the levels of inventory in different hotels or searching for the different routes that flights might take. As an organization, you should purchase software that helps you with these tasks and saves you time. Purchasing software can initially sound a little intimidating as they are expensive if the correct software is chosen for your organization to perform specific tasks then it can help in growing your organization. It will also give you an edge over your competitors in the market as your organization will be more technologically advanced as compared to them.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Developing a healthy and long-term relationship with your clients is the key to instilling the element of trust in them. Once a client feels that your organization is trustworthy, that particular client will automatically be comfortable with the decisions that you take for them. For example, if a client is satisfied with your organization and begins to trust you, he will let you plan their trip for them and all that is left for them to do is pay you. Another benefit of creating long term relationships with your clients is that they will start to feel that whatever you charge from them will be justified as they have never had any bad past experiences with your organization. This will also help your travel agency to create loyal customers which will indirectly lead your travel agency to grow.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n', '', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5f86fc5c32c3e.jpg', 828, '2020-10-14 16:27:12'),

Not only are the costs high for the travel agents but the costs incurred by the customers and the prices that they have to pay are also not that low.

The reason why it is so important to be well aware of all the hotel and flight inventories is that you will know the prices that are being offered by those specific hotels and airlines. Hotel reservations and flight bookings are the most expensive part of traveling, especially the flight bookings, so having access to the inventories and being well informed about the prices means that you have the option to choose from them and offer what is best for your customers. Airlines usually tend to save up the VIP prices for their corporate clients and these prices are not generally available to the public. Having access to those prices and rates means that the travel agency has the power of negotiation in its hands which means lesser prices for the final customer and more profits for the travel agency.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Another important factor </strong>that needs to be taken into consideration is all the planning that goes into the final trip by the travel agency. Whether it is a leisure trip being planned by a group of friends or a business trip being planned by someone who belongs to the corporate sector, it is important to do pre-plan everything ahead of time. This will help you cut up the probable costs that you may have to incur as a travel agent since you will be ruling out all the possibilities of any negative circumstances taking place during the trip of your client. For example, making sure that the hotel rooms are up to the standards of your clients so that they are not disappointed when they reach their hotel. In case the hotel rooms are not up to the standards of your client, the client will ask you to book another hotel room for them whose cost will be incurred by you.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>It is extremely important to inform your customers if their budget is in alignment with all the services that they plan to enjoy during their trip. For example, small things like transportation and wifi facilities may not be accounted for in the beginning but these are those small things that might add up to your total cost at the end of the day. Since the cost will increase, there will be a good chance that it will result in the budget provided by the client not being enough and hence a dissatisfied client at the end of the day. Another reason why it is important to make sure that your client is well aware of all of these expenses is that you, as a travel agency, do not have to incur these costs on the behalf of the customer, in case they were not accounted for beforehand. If that happens, it can greatly add up to your costs and your expenses and the customer will not be held accountable to pay for these expenses as they were not informed about them by you in the first place.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>These days, organizations are more focused on generated more revenues and earning profits but while the organizations are busy doing that, they tend to ignore the main resource that they have which is their employees. Keeping the motivation levels high of your employees is extremely important as they are the main reason why your organization is under operating conditions. Having demotivated employees mean that your costs are automatically going up without you doing much about it. The reason for that is that is your employees are not working up to the standards that you have set for them, they may not efficiently provide the best services to your clients. This automatically means that your customers will be dissatisfied and they may not return to you which is a negative consequence of decreased levels of customer loyalty. All of this will eventually lead to lesser revenues being generated by your travel agency hence lesser profits and higher costs. To avoid your costs being raised because of demotivated employees, it is important to come up with different ways to keep them giving their best performance.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If all of these measures are taken and all of these factors are taken into consideration, your travel agency is bound to generate more revenues hence more profits and decrease the costs that are being incurred along with reducing the risk of the costs increasing in the long run, which will lead your<strong><a href=\"https://www.phptravels.com\"> travel agency</a></strong> to bloom and grow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 'Tips to increase revenues and reduce costs of a travel agency, how increase the revenue of a travel agency in 2020, Tips to increase revenues and reduce costs of a travel agency in 2020', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5f3e628bf2a08.jpg', 845, '2020-08-20 16:27:42'),
(106, 1, 'Common mistakes that can make your travel agency suffer and different ways to avoid them', 'common-mistakes-that-can-make-your-travel-agency-suffer-and-different-ways-to-avoid-them', '<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">With the constant developments being observed day by day, the number of factors disrupting the daily business activities of travel agencies is also increasing day by day. There are several factors that travel agencies, or any other business organization, might have to consider even before taking the tiniest of decisions. For example, if a travel agency decides to come up with a new service that they plan on offering their clients, they might have to consider factors like their budget, to what extent will that new service impact their revenues and the services being offered by their competitors. During the process of considering these factors, travel agencies might end up making a few incorrect decisions or mistakes that can have a massive negative impact on the organization as a whole. However, there are ways to fix the mistakes that have already been made or ways to avoid them altogether.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">One of the most basic and the most common mistake that is made by travel agencies is the lack of personalization that is being offered. People appreciate it when an organization remembers their past purchases and keeps a record or their information, it makes the client feel as if the organization is concerned about their likes and dislikes. Lack of personalization can make it harder for your clients to decide for themselves. For example, there are times when the client themselves are not sure about what they want or what they require, that is when they start to rely on the travel agency to help them out and tell them what is best for them or what is in their interest. Sometimes customers also feel overwhelmed when they see a lot of information being provided on a website of the preferred travel agency because that makes them even more indecisive about their options. A very good and easy way to solve this problem would be to employ a system that helps you keep track of everything related to your previous clients. That way, the customer will also feel hiring your travel agency and they won&rsquo;t consider the other competitive agencies in the market. This will also increase the level of customer loyalty, indirectly.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">The second mistake that is usually made by travel agencies is not offering extended or more complex services to their clients. These days, when a client hires a travel agent or decides to employ a travel agency, they expect the travel agency to take care of every little detail. Clients expect that the travel agency provides them with all the extended services along with the basic ones that are provided by all the other travel agencies. For example, along with making the bookings and the reservations, planning out tours or helping out your client with the visa formalities can be the extended services that your travel agency can offer. Your travel agency can also offer customized packages and discounts according to the preferences and the requirements of your clients.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Travel agencies need to understand and should be able to differentiate business trips and leisure trips. Clients planning a business trip have different demands and requirements as compared to clients who are looking forward to planning a leisure trip. If the travel agencies can do that efficiently, they will be able to save a lot of their time and the travelers&rsquo; money. One of the most prominent differences between a business trip and a leisure trip is the flexibility of dates. On a business trip, the travel agent can not play around with the dates. Price is another factor that can help a travel agency determine the difference. On a business trip, lower prices are not the topmost priority since the top priority of the client is getting things done in an orderly manner. Clients planning a business trip may ask for facilities like a stable wifi connection of a hotel reservation that is closer to the workplace whereas a client planning a leisure trip may inquire about different restaurants or tourist destinations. Knowing what your client wants can be extremely beneficial for both the client and the travel agency as it will save time, money and help the travel agency to understand the demand of its customers better.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Information overload is another mistake that is usually made by travel agencies. A perception has been created that the more information that you provide for your current and potential client to explore, the better it is. This is not always true because you might think that you are indirectly helping out your client but you might end up overwhelming them with all the information that has been uploaded on your website. People usually prefer to get informed about the things that are relevant and helpful only to them, providing a lot of information that is of no use to the client might confuse them. A study conducted showed that 60 percent of the potential clients of an online travel agency leave the website as the information overload confuses them about the decisions they wanted to make. A lot of information may even lead to the ineffectiveness of the relevant information that has been provided. To avoid this problem, your website should be divided into different parts or sections that provide specific information. That way, if a client wants to know about something, they can visit that particular section of your website.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Not having a personal blog is another mistake that is usually made by travel agencies. Having a blog may make your clients feel as if they are getting an opportunity to know more about your travel agency on a personal level. This is a great way to develop a healthy and long-term relationship with your client as they will feel as they can trust your organization and the decision it makes for that particular client. The blog created for your travel agency can have different pictorial articles of a wide variety of different topics, for example, the role played by social media in our lives or the benefits of working with an online travel agency.</span></p>\r\n', '', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5e8c7d0e703ef.jpg', 1423, '2020-04-07 16:28:14'),

Travelling has been made easier because of all these options available but at the same time, it has become more difficult because all the information available can sometimes confuse and overwhelm the traveler. This article will highlight the pros and cons that revolve around hiring a travel agency and will identify the difference in the experience that a traveler may experience in both ways.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Let us start by talking a little about the travel agencies and what their basic role in our lives is. As a traveler, hiring a travel agency would automatically make your life easier. All you have to do is tell them your requirements and provide them will all the information required to plan your trip, pay them and think about enjoying your trip. Hiring a travel agency would mean that everything related to your trip or vacation is being taken care of. From fulfilling all the formalities of visa application to flight bookings and hotel reservations, everything is taken care of by a travel agency that you have chosen to hire. In a shorter sentence, hiring a travel agency is more like a one-stop-shop where you can avail and enjoy all the services that you demand or require. Not only will choosing the correct travel agency help in saving a lot of hassle that the traveler might have to go through, but it will also help the traveler to save a lot of time and not. It will also help the travel agency to generate more business. These days, all the good travel agencies have bought different software that can help them meet the demands and requirements of the customers that can help the travel agency make all the decisions on the clients&rsquo; behalf. A big benefit to travelers in hiring a travel agency is that they can avail of many different discounts and offers and save even more money.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">With the wide variety of travel agencies available from which a traveler can choose from, some people still prefer to travel independently as they feel that they are more comfortable when they are on their own or when they are not associated with any travel agency. Traveling independently means that you get to make all the major decisions yourself and not only the major decisions but also the smaller day to day decisions that you might have to make when you are traveling. A study conducted showed that by traveling independently, a person can spend their entire day with less than 25 dollars of expense. Some people also have the perception that by traveling independently, they will be able to save up a lot of money as they would not have to pay for the services that they might have availed if they hired a travel agency to do all the work for them. Not only does the traveler has to pay for the services but a part of the costs of the organization and a part of the profit margin of the organization is also borne by the traveler. Another advantage that travelers seem to enjoy when traveling independently is that they are not restricted to a particular routine or a schedule that has been designed for them. They get to eat, sleep, and go wherever they want whenever they want. However, this can also be a disadvantage because a person naturally needs some form of guidance when they are traveling alone on foreign land.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">When a traveler decides to hire a travel agency, choosing the correct travel agency that fits your needs and requirements is the first and the most important step that needs to be taken extremely cautiously. First and foremost, you need to finalize and list down all of your needs and requirements that you expect the travel agency to fulfill. After you have shortlisted all of your needs, requirements, expectations and most importantly your budget, that is when you start searching for an appropriate travel agency.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">In today&#39;s world, research can be done through multiple different mediums but the best and the fastest way is to Google the most suitable travel agency. Once the traveler feels that the correct travel agency has been found, that is the time when the traveler should reach out to the travel agency, talk to the agent and try to negotiate the price and work upon the rest of the requirements. This is also the time when the travel agency can identify and educate the traveler about how they function and what to expect from them. Most travel agencies are in association with different organizations or institutions, for example, hotels and airlines, in different countries. Once the traveler has provided the travel agency with all the relevant information that is required, the travel agency starts to plan and organize the trip for the traveler to enjoy. When it comes to the travel agency to provide the services that they have promised or the services that have been demanded by the traveler, it is important that there is an effective and efficient communication network between the travel agency and the traveler themselves. That is because it is important to provide the traveler with constant updates as to how much work has been done. Not only an efficient communication network is important between the traveler and the travel agency but it is also essential to have an efficient and effective communication network between the travel agency and the different organizations globally. This is important because the travel agency will be aware and will have access to the inventories of different organizations, for example, hotels and airlines, and can make reservations for the traveler accordingly.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Traveling independently is always an option for everyone. As long as you have done an ample amount of research that is related to your desired trip and if you are confident enough to deal with any possible inconveniences or handle and organize the entire trip on your own, then traveling independently should not be a big problem for you. However, hiring a travel agent also has its&rsquo; advantages as mentioned above and it is always the best and the safest option one can go for.</span></p>\r\n', 'Traveling independently , hiring a travel agency, travel industry', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5e898f3977d24.jpg', 1158, '2020-04-05 16:28:34'),

Establishing a business can be stressful putting advertising and marketing your business correctly is even more important. This is the same as all businesses, even travel agencies. Unless people know about your organization or what you are offering, you will not be able to gain any benefits from all the effort you initially put in to establish your business.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Traveling independently is not easy at all, in fact, it can really stress people out, so the demand for travel agencies is still high. But with the high levels of competition in different markets, it is important to put in extra effort in order to beat your competitors. As people try to avoid as much hassle as they could, they prefer to hire a travel agency to plan and organize their trips for them but letting your potential clients know that your organization exists is the key to generating more clients.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">First and foremost, it is extremely important to come up with a basic strategy that will be implemented throughout your travel agency in order to effectively advertise. A strategy consists of two main parts, the plan, and the objectives. The objectives include the long-term and the short-term goals of your organization that need to be met and a plan is a way to meet those objectives that have been met. In the case of advertising, the main objective would be to put your organization out there in the market and generate more clients. If we classify this even further, the short-term plan could attract more clients and the long-term objective could be increasing the number of revenues being generated through those clients and the level of business growth.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Once these particular objectives have been set and highlighted, a plan helps the organization to achieve those objectives in a particular time frame. In the plan, the current situation of advertising should also be highlighted. For example, the current modes of advertising that the travel agency is implementing and how effective they have proven to be. A travel agency should never solely rely on a specific medium of advertising for long periods of time. For example, if a travel agency has been advertising its services through social media or text messages for a very long period of time, the advertisement might end up being ineffective after some time. It is better to keep switching between different mediums of advertising in order to capture and retain the attention of your target audience.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Another way of effective advertising can be through creative online advertisements for your travel agency. You can create pages on different social media platforms such as Instagram or Facebook in order to increase the level of viewership. These days, almost every other person has a phone with Facebook or Instagram installed in it so it will be extremely easy to capture the attention of people through these social media platforms. Different codes and special discounts can also be offered to those people to approach your travel agency through those pages on social media. This way, more people will feel inclined towards viewing your page as they will be interested in availing different offers and discounts. A big advantage of using these social media platforms is that you can be as creative as you want you. You have the option of using different pictorial images and videos. People usually feel inclined towards colorful images and videos which will help you to attract new clients.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Different bloggers and influencers can also be approached and paid in order to help you advertise your travel agency. People tend to trust bloggers and social media influencers as they feel that they can relate to these bloggers and influencers on a personal level so hiring them to advertise your travel agency can prove to be beneficial for you. One thing that you need to keep in mind before deciding on which social media platform you want to use is how much viewership you expected to gain from that platform. A study conducted stated that 86 percent of the travel agencies use Facebook as they find advertising their organization through Facebook to be more effective. This decision also depends on the demographics of your target audience.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">A potential client is most likely to have a look at your social media accounts, but they will most definitely visit the official website of your travel agency in order to gain more information regarding what you have to offer. It is important to keep the overall look and the design of your website colorful and attractive. If the website of your travel agency is dull, it will probably bore your potential client which will result in them looking for other travel agencies whom they find to be more attractive, who are also your competitors. It is important to keep your website informative but providing too much information can result in an information overload. When an information overload occurs, the viewer is unable to retain high levels of information being provided and hence all the efforts of designing your website go to waste.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Another thing that is extremely important is to design your website in such a way that it is interactive and that your current or potential clients can have all of their questions and queries addressed. Another important factor that needs to be considering before designing your website is that your website should be designed in such a way that it can also be used by people through mobile phones without having to go through a lot of hassle. A study conducted showed that almost 50 percent of the people visit different websites through their mobile phones so if your website is not optimized for people using mobile phones then you might end up losing that 50 percent, which is a massive chunk of your revenues, to your competitors.</span></p>\r\n', 'successful advertisement,  best ways to market, good marketing strategy, successful marketing ways', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5e82f95c4f600.jpg', 1125, '2020-03-31 16:29:09'),

It shows the amount of investment that has been done and indirectly, it also shows how expanded and well established that particular chain of hotels is. Managing the inventory of your hotel is a very big task for a hotelier because you need to make sure how much inventory is tied up and how much of it is occupied. You need to stay updated about the levels of hotel inventory at all times to manage your Consumer demand accordingly. Efficiently managing the hotel inventory can prove to be extremely beneficial for your hotel in the long run. For example, Marriott increased its annual revenues by 200 million dollars when they introduced inventory management systems.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Inventory management is a very broad term that includes the management of a hotels&rsquo; room inventory. It includes understanding and controlling the inventories in such a way that it not only generates but also increases the consumer demand and hence the revenues. Analyzing and keeping a constant check on your inventory is important because it also helps you to determine the seasons in which you get the maximum demand and the seasons in which you get the lowest demand. That way, it makes it easier for you to manage the high demand season and helps you to generate more demand in the trough seasons. The concept of dynamic pricing can also be implemented to generate demand in the trough seasons. Dynamic pricing is a strategy in which your prices change according to the demand being generated. Inventory management also helps the hotel to be aware of the prices being offered by the competitors and helps the online travel agencies to choose from the hotels available depending on the level of transparency of the prices being offered.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">The hotels need to come up with different balanced strategies that can help them track and promote their hotel inventories to the travel agencies. If the inventories are not managed properly, it can create a lot of financial problems for the hotel itself along with the travel agency. Technology has played a major role in helping the hotels and the travel agencies to keep a track of the inventories and hence manage the demand that is being generated. If the travel agencies as updated with the inventories, they will be able to book the best hotel suited to their client. One of the ways through which the advanced observed in technology has helped the travel agencies to have access to and keep track of the hotel inventories if through knowing the lead time. To maximize the number of revenues being generated by a travel agency, you need to know the time it will take to sell the hotel rooms. Travel agencies can then accordingly, know how much access they require to the inventories of different hotels.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Another important factor that online travel agencies need to consider is the level of distribution. This means that the travel agencies need to know the minimum amount of hotel bookings that they need to make to maintain their revenues or how much more hotel bookings are required which will help them to increase their revenues. Different booking engines can also be used that can greatly help the travel agencies to keep track of the distribution of the different hotel inventories. If we think about the distribution of hotel inventories in this aspect, the travel agencies need to keep track of the inventories so that they can manage their bookings accordingly. Travel agencies also need to keep track and constantly monitor the sales and the demand of the hotel inventories to effectively promote, maintain and manage the levels of inventories. Different software can be used to help the travel agencies to take care of the inventories.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Having the correct type of technology within your organization is extremely important for the travel agencies to have access to hotel inventories and sell them online because this is something that can not happen if your travel agency is not in alignment with the other departments within the organization, for example, the marketing team, the finance team, and the team responsible for the sales management. There is a big variety of different software in the market that have been developed in the last few numbers of years that can help your travel agency to understand the different organizational departments a little better and help you stay in alignment with them. If your travel agency purchases any of the software available in the market, your travel agency will have all the information that is required from within the organization and multiple decisions can be made simultaneously without wasting much time. Purchasing software may sound a little intimidating at first or even maybe a waste of money but if your travel agency purchases the correct software, it can prove to be extremely beneficial for your travel agency in the long run.</span></p>\r\n', 'hotels inventory, global hotels rooms, hotels rooms inventory, sell hotels online', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5e6f89c6e2076.jpg', 1140, '2020-03-16 16:29:35'),

In general, terms, marketing your business means putting your business out there and letting people know what you have in store to offer. Marketing is extremely important because it creates a perception about the product or service that you are offering in the minds of your client, for example, if you want to create a perception or an image that you are offering high-end products or services then you will market your brand accordingly. Businesses sometimes tend to lose focus and they stop concentrating on marketing their organization once they have established themselves. This is when people in organizations start to make big mistakes that are related to marketing that can eventually be harmful for their organization in the long run and the short run. When we talk specifically about travel agencies, marketing your travel agencies is extremely important because it is that one particular key driver of high levels of sales. If you are unable to market your travel agency properly, you may end up losing your current customers and may lose your potential customers to your competitors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">One of the major and the most common marketing mistakes that are made by travel agencies are not giving enough importance to your mission and vision statements. A mission statement helps you to identify your goals and objectives as an organization and a vision statement helps you visualize your organization as a whole. If you are not clear about both of these or if you don&rsquo;t have specific vision and mission statements for your organization, you may end up creating a perception in the minds of your customers that the organization is not sure about what it wants or what it is about. If your values are not expressed accurately, your travel agency will not be able to attract more customers and might even end up losing the ones that it has already acquired. Another major benefit of having a mission and a vision statement is that helps you to identify the key elements of your organization and clears up any ambiguities that might be there in the clients&rsquo; mind. A good way to put your mission and vision statements out there is to upload them on your official website so that it is there for everyone to view.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Another major mistake is the inconsistency when it comes to marketing your organization. Usually, travel agencies have this perception that they only need to market their organization when they feel that they are failing in meeting the objectives that they have set for their organization. Marketing your organization efficiently and effectively requires a consistent effort because you need to make sure that your current and potential clients remember you. Your travel agency needs to market itself in such a way that it makes a lasting impression on the minds of your customers and whenever they feel the need that they require the services of a travel agency, the name of your organization should instantly pop up in their head. This can be done through advertising your travel agency through different mediums such are print, radio, television, and different social media platforms. Effective marketing and advertising are important however you also need to make sure that there is no information overload otherwise your efforts can go to waste.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Not having a unique selling point of your travel agency can be another major mistake that might make which will eventually cost you a lot in the long run. You need to differentiate your travel agency from that of your competitors in one way or another. Having a unique selling point can sometimes prove to be extremely attractive for the customers. Sometimes, travelers even look for that one particular quality that you have in your business that is not there in the rest of the travel agencies whom you are competing against. Simply claiming that your travel agency is better than your competitors of you can offer better quality services as compared to your competitors is not enough because every other organization makes this claim. One thing that can set you apart from the rest of the travel agencies is finding a way to quantify and give proper reasoning as to how the services that you are offering are better than that of your competitors. Furthermore, the main of your travel agency should be more on outlining and pointing out the benefits to the potential clients if they avail of your services rather than just talking about the features of your organization, your travel agency should always have a more customer-oriented approach. Being in business for a long period means that you are established but the client will never be interested in knowing the story of your organization unless it benefits them in one way or another.</span></p>\r\n', '', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5e6b6a34e701e.jpg', 2479, '2020-03-13 16:30:01'),

This team involves a group of people who are specifically hired for taking care of your website and making sure that all of your current and potential clients are always updated about everything related to your travel agency. Recently, a trend has been started where people start their travel blogs. Operating a travel blog can be expensive because you are constantly traveling and keeping your audience updated about the different tourist destinations and many other things about travel, and only traveling alone can sometimes cost you an arm and a leg. A great idea would be to find a way through which you could earn through a travel blog. This article will prove to be helpful to you in finding a way to monetize your travel blog through the concept of affiliate marketing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Affiliate marketing is a concept that is implemented by many people these days. In affiliate marketing, you earn money in the form of commission by promoting other people or the products or services being provided by different organizations. You can promote different products or services of the advertisers and earn through the sales that you might experience. In the case of a travel blog, you can earn through promoting services like ticket booking, tour planning and hotel reservations that are being offered by a specific travel agency. You, the publisher, is an intermediary between the advertiser which is the travel agency and the final customer to avails the services that are being promoted.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">There are multiple different categories from which you get to choose from especially when you are running a travel blog. You can imply the concept of affiliate marketing in one specific area or you can focus on different areas of the consumer interest based on your liking. Having a wide variety to choose from is not the only advantage that you will enjoy but another major advantage is that you are bound to earn through affiliate marketing in the travel industry as this specific industry is constantly increasing. According to a study, it has been estimated that the travel industry has globally generated over 8.8 trillion dollars in the year 2018 and this amount has been increasing ever since. So, if you work intelligently enough, you can generate a good amount by doing promotions for a travel agency.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">By now the concept of affiliate marketing may sound very attractive to you but there are some key concepts that you need to keep in mind to make sure that it is effective and that your promotions have been successful. First and foremost, you need to understand and be familiar with the basic concept of affiliate marketing. To avoid some of the very basic mistakes and save up some extra minutes. CPA Marketing and Super Affiliate Playbook are some of the courses that can help you become more familiar with the concepts of affiliate marketing. These two courses provide extremely basic information that will help you understand the general concepts of affiliate marketing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">The most crucial and the most important part of affiliate marketing is finding the correct programs that suit your needs and the ones that can accommodate you easily. Affiliate marketing can sound intimidating in the beginning but one the correct program has been found, it is not as complex as it sounds to the ear. You can do some of your research as there is a wide variety of programs that you can choose from but it is important to understand your needs as well for example in a pay-per-action program, you are paid according to the positive action that is a result from the customers side of your promotion and a pay-per-click program suggests that you are paid according to the number of clicks that are observed by the customers based on your promotion. It is important to do your research and explore a large number of affiliate programs that are out there to understand your needs and your requirements in the best way possible. Along with exploring the affiliate programs, you will also have to do some research to find the best affiliate network that is appropriate for the advertiser and the promotor. The affiliate network plays a role that is similar to that which is played by the affiliate marketer. The affiliate marketer is an intermediary between the final customer and the advertiser or the travel agency. Similarly, affiliate networks also play the role of an intermediary between the travel agency or the advertiser and the affiliate marketer themselves. Having a good and effective affiliate network is as important as finding the right niche for you to target or selecting the best program that suits your needs. That is because having a good affiliate network means effective, efficient and productive communication between the travel agency and the affiliate marketer. Awin, Commission Junction and Travelpayouts are some of the largest and the most effective affiliate networks being used currently.</span></p>\r\n', '', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5e6a0eb97eb5e.jpg', 1134, '2020-03-12 16:30:33');

We are currently living in an era in which almost every person of the age of 18 or above has some kind of electronic device with them, either a smartphone, a tablet or a computer. Being dependent on so many electronic devices automatically means that the way we live our daily lives has changed a lot over the decades. This change was not only observed in our daily lives but also the world of travel industries. The travel agencies have started operating differently and this change has been observed over many years. This change was not only observed in the travel industries over the globe but changes have also been observed in the patterns of demands of the travelers. This article provides some of the factors that are considered important by travelers and what they expect from a good travel agency.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">The first and the most important thing that a traveler seeks for in a travel agency is professional expertise. A traveler will also look up to the recommendations provided by his or her agent especially if they are planning on going on the trip that includes a lot of complexities and requires a lot of homework to be done. The traveler will expect his travel agent to advise him what is best for them and plans out a trip that is both enjoyable and lies within the budget of the traveler. It has been estimated that there is an 80 to 85 percent chance that the traveler is likely to hire a travel agent who is planning to take care of all the planning of their trip on their own. This is why the travel agency must provide the best and the most practical advice to the traveler. Also, good travel agents are trained in such a way that they can understand the needs and the requirements of their customers in the best way possible. A good travel agent will also be well aware of how to fulfill those needs and requirements along with making their customers happy lying within the budget of their respective customers.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">People are always concerned about saving their money especially when it comes to traveling because traveling in itself can sometimes be too expensive. Generally, people have this perception that if they hire an intermediary, in this case, a travel agent, to help them plan out their entire trip for them, their costs might end up increasing because not only will they have to pay for the trip but they will also have to pay for the services that they avail that are being provided by the travel agent. This is a very big misconception that people had but now people who plan on traveling prefer to hire a travel agent to take care of all the things for the. This not only generates business for the travel agency but it also helps the traveler to save some money as the travel agents usually come up with deals and packages for their clients that are best suited to their needs. Along with saving money, by hiring a travel agent the travel does not have to worry about anything and can focus on enjoying their trip.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">These days travelers also depend on the travel agent to take care of the little details that may have to potential to completely ruin the trip of the traveler. Weather checks or the quality of hotel rooms that are reserved for the traveler are good examples of some of the tiny matters that are handled by the travel agent. If it starts raining in the middle of the trip or if the quality of the hotel rooms is not up to the mark, the traveler may end up getting so disappointed that they feel the need to cancel the rest of their trip altogether. Travelers prefer to relay on travel agents to take care of such things and to keep them updated. Not only does this reduces the weight on the shoulders of the traveler but this also helps to save some extra minutes that can be used somewhere else by the traveler. In short, travelers prefer to have a security net that will catch them in case they fall. This also helps to develop some degree of trust and reliance between the travel agency and the customer.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">These days, with all the modernizations and the latest technology, every person knows exactly what he or she wants. Whether it is traveling or any other decision that needs to be made in a persons&rsquo; life, all the information needed and the homework required is done beforehand. That is why travel agencies need to make sure that all the information that is required by a potential traveler can be given to them without much difficulty. A traveler will always visit the official website of the desired travel agency and the traveler will most definitely visit the websites and try to gather information about other travel agencies as well. Gathering all the relevant and useful information can be considered the right of the traveler so it is important that the website of the travel agency is always up to date and does not provide any irrelevant information. A travel agency must make sure that all the relevant information is provided on its website that its targeted audience may require. On the other hand, providing way too much information may result in information overload that may confuse the traveler and make them even more indecisive about their decisions.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n', 'travel agency services, travel agency products, travel services, travel agency basic services', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5e5f77dd5a3bb.jpg', 1289, '2020-03-04 16:35:47'),

The Coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, has greatly affected our lives negatively and is continuing to do so. It has affected the pattern of our lives which includes traveling. The spread of coronavirus initially started in December of 2019 and since then it has spread and victimized people from over 20 countries. The situation that is being dealt with right now is pretty similar to that of 2003 when there was a SARS outbreak in China which greatly affected the tourism industry of that particular country. In today&#39;s world, tourism is a very big industry that greatly contributes to the GDP and the economies of different areas. According to a credible source, approximately 10.4 percent of the GDP is generated through the tourism industry along with 10 percent of global employment. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">With the spread of the coronavirus all over Europe, Asia, the United States, the Middle East and other parts of the globe, people are questioning their decisions about traveling because of the fright they have that they might end up contracting the disease. People are avoiding traveling and are preferring to cancel their plans instead of going along with them and risking their health. Strict rules have been implemented throughout the airports globally and the body temperature of every passenger is individually being checked. However, there still is a slight risk, because higher body temperatures are not the only symptom of catching this virus. There are many more symptoms which include dry cough, tiredness and body aches. The spread of coronavirus has greatly accelerated because of healthy people contracting the virus from the patients.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">With the continuous levels of acceleration of this particular virus, strict bans have been implemented when it comes to traveling to or from the countries of China, Iran, Italy, and South Korea. These bans have been implemented by the CDC. The same agency has also given warnings to travelers and has implemented rules of lower strictness levels on traveling to or from other countries. If a person is traveling in such a situation, first and foremost, they should be well informed and do their research on the disease control centers of that particular area. If that country is well equipped and if the traveler takes all the precautionary measures, they are unlikely to contract the disease.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">In case a person has already booked a trip that they may want to cancel because of the global pandemic that is going on, </span></span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">there is a very high level of possibility that you may not get the entire amount refunded that you initially invested on your trip. The decision that has to be made regarding traveling or canceling the trip, however, solely depends on you and your preferences. You might end up getting a refund if your final destination is China, Iran, Italy or any of the areas of the world whose majority of the population has contracted the virus but all depends on the airline that you chose. The best idea in such a situation would be to constantly be in touch with your travel agency and ask them to keep providing you with constant updates.z</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">When it comes to the effects on the global travel industry because of the coronavirus, the first and the most obvious one is the way it has affected the imports and exports of different countries. Because of the coronavirus, people have started to fear trading with other countries as they feel that the products that are being exchanged might end up bringing the virus in their countries. Secondly, businessmen who solely relied on traveling for business purposes are continuously suffering because of this virus. That is mainly because of the ban that has been implemented in different countries by different governments. A good example could be Pakistan and China. A lot of raw material for the clothing industry in Pakistan comes from China, but ever since the spread of coronavirus accelerated in China and ended up spreading into different countries, the imports from China of the raw material for clothing has completely stopped. Because of this, not only is the clothing industry of Pakistan suffering but also the businessmen and owners of different factories that manufacture clothes. Because of this, people are losing their jobs and the economy, in general, is greatly suffering.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">When we talk about traveling for leisure purposes or booking a trip with your loved ones, if you have already booked and are confused about deciding if you should travel or not, the best idea would be to talk to your travel agent and get in touch with the airline directly. Airlines are quite flexible these days, because of the global pandemic, as they would not want to lose their clients and are offering different ways and solutions to people who want a change in their plans. For example, Jet Blue is not charging its customers who plan on changing their traveling plans from February 27<sup>th,</sup> 2020 up to March 11<sup>th,</sup> 2020 for travel completed by June 1<sup>st,</sup> 2020. The best approach, however, would be to wait and watch if the situation gets better and the spread of the coronavirus is brought under the control of not before planning on traveling.</span></span></p>\r\n', '', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5e8ecc1d049cf.jpg', 1236, '2020-04-09 06:57:18'),

A few decades ago, people used to communicate with each other through letters which would sometimes take months. Now, we can send a text message to our employees or loved ones within a matter of a few seconds. A major part of our lives is traveling, along with the rest of the things, technology has completely transformed that part of our lives as well. We, however, have benefitted from the change that has been resulted by technological advancements because of the high levels of personalization and convenience offered to us.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Artificial intelligence has started to play an extremely important role in our lives especially when it comes to traveling. Almost a decade ago, the concept of artificial intelligence and the usage of robotics in the travel industry seemed to be extremely bizarre, unrealistic and futuristic but nowadays, different airports and airlines have started to incorporate this particular concept within their organizations and have also started seeking many benefits out of it. It is, however, a little expensive and requires a large amount of initial investment but the benefits that different organizations are enjoying by employing them completely cover up the initial cost that they had to pay in the form of investment. When we talk about traveling, one of the biggest barriers that are usually faced by people is the language barrier and robotics have made it easy for people to overcome this particular barrier. Moreover, these robots also help to cut down the cost of the organization, let it be an airport or an airline, because they do not have to pay more people to do that particular job. Schiphol airport and Geneva airport have already introduced robotics into their systems and have greatly benefitted from them. These robots help in guiding people about the flights, recognize the emotions of the customers and are designed in a way to cope up with any unexpected situation that may arise.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">One of the most common complaints that people nowadays have is the inconvenience that they have to face when they lose or misplace their luggage. But thanks to all the technological advances, a very good solution to this problem has also been generated.

The first and most important factor that needs to be taken under consideration is the level of connectivity between your hotel and different intermediaries along with the efficiency and effectiveness of the communication that is taking place between them. If you are unable to communicate and connect with your supplier, different airlines and travel agencies, that means that you need to come up with a system that keeps people within your organization and people within the affiliated organizations constantly up to date. One of the main reasons why this is so important is that removes the factor of uncertainty and helps you avoid overbooking. It also helps you keep track of all of your inventories and helps you manage them better.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Another major factor that needs to be considered is the size and the occupation of your property. What this means is that the size of your hotel will have a massive impact on the operations and how different things are being looked after. In other words, the larger your property is, the harder it is to make decisions about it and making sure that everything is running smoothly. This is an extremely important factor because if your hotel chain is very large, it is most likely earning a large number of profits but on the other hand, it is also a possibility that making decisions is equally, or even more, harder than it would have if your hotel chain was not that vast. This also means that even a single incorrect decision of yours or even the smallest of the mistakes can have a very big impact on your hotel chain. Having that said, it is important to analyze the size of your property and then invest in an appropriate hotel manager to improve your decision-making skills and avoiding all the problems or errors that could result in negative consequences that your hotel might have to face.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">You should be very well aware of the needs and requirements of your hotel along with all the errors that need to be corrected to make a wise decision about choosing the appropriate channel manager.

Investing in a hotel has always been considered profitable because the tourism industry is constantly growing and the love for traveling is also growing in peoples&rsquo; hearts. This means that people will naturally require a place to live in that also provides different services such as restaurant and entertainment areas. Because of this constantly growing demand, people are showing interest in investing in hotels and this industry is growing day by day. However, since 2008, there has been a massive threat to hotels all over the world. That threat is Airbnb. Saving money always seems a good idea and people are always up for saving some extra bucks, keeping this in mind, Airbnb has successfully captured a big chunk of the revenues and profits that were once earned by the hotels. Because of this, hotels have had to suffer a lot.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">A study conducted showed that with the hotel bookings decreasing because of Airbnb, Airbnb captured 1.3 percent of the market share that once belonged to the hotels which resulted in the hotels suffering a massive chunk, 1.5 percent, of their revenues. These numbers have not remained the same ever since the data was evaluated but have increased dramatically over the last five years. The majority of the market, approximately 10 to 12 percent according to one study, that has been captured by Airbnb is in New York City, London, and Paris. This data is only constricted to The United States of America. If we consider the data from different hotels globally, then the numbers are even larger. Losses in revenues and profits are the main reason why Airbnb is considered to be the biggest enemy of the hotel industry.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">The average price of the services offered through Airbnb is a lot lower and economical as compared to the services that are being offered at a regular hotel. Earning money through fair means in today&#39;s world is extremely hard and difficult so people are always looking for different ways through which they can save some bucks that can be later on used somewhere else. One of the main attractions for travelers for using Airbnb is that they will be saving a lot of money if they choose Airbnb over a hotel. Another main reason for choosing Airbnb over hotels is that traveling in itself is extremely costly and expensive. There are several factors that you need to consider before planning a trip which includes spending money on food, outings, the money spend to purchase the flight tickets and fees of the travel agent. Amongst all these big expenses, saving up some money always seems a good idea. Moreover, the core services being offered by hotels and Airbnb and pretty much the same so another reason why people end up choosing Airbnb over regular hotels is that they only consider the core services that are being offered to them and completely ignore the supplementary services that come with the core services in a hotel. For example, services such as the access to the pool or the gymnasium are not offered in Airbnb, however, they are offered at different hotels.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">With the increase in demand for the services being provided by Airbnb, customers automatically end up expecting that the quality of the services that they are about to pay for will also be good. The quality of the services being provided through Airbnb is increasing as compared to that of the hotels, this has resulted in the customer not even considering staying in a hotel. The reason for that is that is has become a lot easier for the potential customers to draw a comparison between the two and make their final decision which is, majority of the time, in favor of Airbnb. The rates of Airbnb are also increasing between they are still substantially lower than that of the hotels so when the customers draw a comparison between Airbnb and the hotel they were thinking of choosing, they do not even consider the rise in prices of the services being provided through Airbnb since they are still lower than that of the good hotels of that particular area.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Since Airbnb has constantly been capturing the market shares of the hotels in different parts of the world, it has become harder for the hotels to earn revenues which have automatically resulted in a decrease in the profitability of the overall hotel industry. Because of this, the profit margins of the hotels have been decreased and it has become even harder for these hotels to cover up their costs. So, to avoid any financial losses and to cover up their costs in an effective way, the prices and rate of the services being provided at the hotels have increased which are expected to be borne by the final consumer. As a result, the difference between the prices of hotels and services provided through Airbnb has increased even more which has resulted in more and more people being attracted to and considering Airbnb over hotels.</span></span></p>\r\n', '', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5eb1790e925a9.jpg', 1177, '2020-05-05 07:09:16'),

Especially when a person is traveling, they feel obligated to post as many pictures as possible as they have the attracted to getting the most number of likes and comments on their posts which means that they are appreciated and accepted by the people around them. Because of the constant updates being provided by travelers on social media, more and more people are attracted to travel as well. This is the main reason why the demand for traveling the tourism industry is constantly increasing. Another reason for this constant increase is the attractive tourist destinations that people want to visit.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">It would be extremely intelligent if one takes full advantage of this constantly increasing demand which could prove to be extremely profitable in the short and the long run. That is where establishing a travel agency comes into play. The first and the most important thing that you need to do in understand the market in which you will be operating. What this means is that it is extremely important to understand the demand that you are aiming to generate and, more importantly, your competitors in the market. Usually what happens is that the large, well-established, travel agencies completely wipe out the new smaller travel agencies in the market. That is why it is important to know who you will be working for and competing against. It is also important to highlight and establish your short term and long term goals and objectives in the initial stages so that you are clear about what you plan on achieving.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Next comes identifying the different market segments and making a decision about which segments does your organization wants to target. Studying and understanding your target market and target audience is extremely important because a lot of your important decisions will depend on the targeted audience. The most important decision that you will have to make is the prices that you set for the services that you will be offering. This is important because you want to come up with a pricing strategy that will help you to successfully compete against your competitors and at the same time also allows your organization to grow and earn revenues. Pricing is the most essential part of any organization because it is the only long-lasting way for you to earn revenues and generate more and more profits. However, it is also important to make sure that your prices are not so high that you drive your potential clients a way to your competitors.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">How you introduce your travel agency to the world can also greatly impact the level of success or failure of your travel agency in the future. Marketing your travel agency is extremely important because unless you put your travel agency out there in the world, you will not receive any demand which means that you will have no way of generating any revenues. Marketing and advertising your travel agency can be done in several ways but positive word of mouth and social media marketing has proved to be the most effective ways as we are living in a completely digitized era. Most of the time, when an organization is new to the market, the use of well-known people such as bloggers and influencers is made. This is done because these bloggers and influencers usually have a large number of people following them on their social media accounts, and people also trust what they say.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">It is also important to design the services that you are offering in such a way that it helps you in generating more revenues, fulfills the demand of the customers and gives you an edge over your competitors in the market. To do that, the ideas that are birthed within your travel agency must be extremely innovative and different. Another important thing that should be kept in mind is that the umbrella of your organization should be very big which covers most of the services. This is important because your clients will feel that their money is being valued and that they are getting the most out of what they paid for.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Once all of these steps are taken, managing your travel agency is extremely important and if not done correctly, your travel agency can fall apart. Thanks to technological advancements, much different software have been developed that can help in managing your travel agency. Initially, investing in software that suits your organization may seem a little intimidating as they usually come with a big price tag, but in the long run, they can prove to be extremely helpful and can end up cutting some of the costs of your travel agency.</span></span></p>\r\n', '', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5ea045eaa6747.jpg', 1152, '2020-04-22 07:09:43'),
(130, 1, 'What are the requirements that need to be completed to start your travel agency?', 'what-are-the-requirements-that-need-to-be-completed-to-start-your-travel-agency', '<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Before establishing and introducing business in the market, some factors need to be taken into consideration. These factors include the current situation of the economy, the expected growth of your organization, its&rsquo; expected profitability and the level of competition that you might have to face. Considering all of these factors is important because they will help you make all the important decisions about your business before you even start it, which will help it in growing and being successful in the future. Similarly, other than these important factors that need to be taken into consideration, many other factors have also been to be considered which include all the legal formalities that need to be completed. First and foremost, you need to understand and study the different options that you have of different business structures. This is important because the structure of your travel agency will help you in evaluating the taxation system of your business.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">The two most common business structures in the world of travel industries include a limited liability company, LLC, and a sole proprietorship. Most of the people who are considering opening a travel agency of their own are usually attracted more towards the option of a limited liability company. The main reason for that is that the owner of a limited liability company can be shared and you can go into partnership with 2 to 20 other parties. Another major benefit of starting a limited liability company is that you don&rsquo;t have to bear the losses on your own and they are shared amongst all the parties that are involved. However, on the other hand, a slight disadvantage is that the profits of a limited liability company are also shared. A sole proprietorship business is the one in which the ownership of the business belongs to a single person. For some people, who want to start on a smaller scale, it is considered to be a safer and easier option because it does not require a lot of legal formalities that need to be taken care of. Another advantage of a sole proprietorship is that you can start small and as your business starts to grow, and as it gets more profitable, you can expand it by turning it into a limited liability company. An employee identification number, EIN, however, is required to start a sole proprietorship.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Getting your bookings done or planning your trip through a travel agency is not a very big hassle these days since a lot of the process that goes into it has been made easier for us and a lot of hassle has been taken care of. However, there is a lot that goes into a travel agency before it is successfully established in the market and before it starts earning profits that you could enjoy. Your travel agency should be recognized and established through certain institutions and organizations before can be established. These organizations include The Airline Reporting Corporation and International Airlines Travel Agents Network. The International Airlines Travel Agents Network has been more popular amongst the travel industries over the past 25 years approximately, however it does charge an annual fee of approximately 195 American dollars.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">As mentioned above, one of the major advantages of having an organization that has the structure of sole proprietorship is that there are not many legal formalities that need to be completed to start your own business or establish your organization. Having that said, it is not necessary to be accredited by The Airline Reporting Corporation or the International Airlines Travel Agents Network. However, not being recognized by these organizations can cost you an arm and a leg in the long run. It is always a good idea to be recognized and accredited by these organizations because that way, the commission will be paid to you by the suppliers for booking the products or services being offered by them. However, your organization or travel agency will be required to make a certain amount of sales before it is accredited. This is the main reason why the majority of the new travel agencies usually start by working with a host travel agency. This means that the new travel agency enters into a partnership with a travel agency that has already been established in the market and is already accredited by The Airline Reporting Corporation or the International Airline Travel Agents Network.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Once all of these procedures have been taken care of, it is extremely important to market and advertises your travel agency appropriately so that you can generate demand for your organization. A good way of marketing and advertising your travel agency can be through getting your travel agency registered on TripAdvisor, Yelp, MakeMyTrip, and Google. Another helpful way can be social media advertising, which means advertising through different social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter or asking your respective clients to post different reviews of the services they availed that are being offered by your travel agency.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5e981c0845ff7.jpg', 1308, '2020-04-16 07:10:27'),
(131, 1, 'Different ways in which the local travel industries are evolving globally.', 'different-ways-in-which-the-local-travel-industries-are-evolving-globally', '<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">The world around us has changed in many different ways. We do not physically have to be present in a particular area to experience something new. The virtual world around us is growing day by day and the credit for this goes to all the technological advances that are being observed around us. Because of these technological advancements, almost everything around us has an online version of it, for example, shops and travel agencies. Everything can be done in a matter of a few seconds within a few clicks, and the credit for this convenience goes to the technology around us. The travel industry has also changed tremendously. The biggest change that is observed around us in respect of the travel industry is that the online travel agencies are replacing the traditional travel agencies. One of the biggest advantages of virtual or online travel agencies is that it does not require a lot of initial investment. Starting an online travel agency does however require some sort of financial investment but a lot of money can be saved in many different ways such as investing in a physical workplace or investing in pamphlets and brochures to advertise your travel agency.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Another unique way that the travel industry has evolved over the years is the way it is advertised and marketed to the world. The traditional ways of advertising include getting brochures and pamphlets printed, and advertising through television ads, TVCs, or through billboards. These ways are very old school and traditional, however, there is one big problem with them that was usually ignored until the modern ways of advertising came about. That problem was them not having a big enough to its targeted audience. This is considered as a very big problem because unless people know about your organization and unless your target audience learns about the benefits that they will be enjoying is they choose your organization over your competitors, you will not be able to generate any demand which automatically means that you will not be able to earn any revenues hence no profits. With the technological advancements observed in the past few decades, the ways through which travel agencies were advertised has also changed drastically.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">The use of social media marketing is being done through different social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Using such social media platforms is a very intelligent way of putting your organization our there in the world. The reason for that is that these days almost every other person has some sort of social media presence so advertising your travel agency would mean that you are reaching out there and communicating your message to a lot more people as compare to reaching and communicating with the masses through traditional advertising styles that have been mentioned above. Different travel agencies in the travel industries have also started reaching out to different bloggers and influencers on these social media platforms because the regular people, who are generally a part of the target audience, tend to trust these bloggers and influencers, and they believe what is said to them through these personalities. Bloggers and influencers are usually paid to post different pictures and stories on their social media platforms that are related to the travel agency. They are also sometimes asked to review the services of the travel agencies once they have been availed or consumed by that particular social media blogger or influencer.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Another extremely noticeable way through which the travel industry has changed and evolved in the way they function and manage their organizations altogether. Back in the day, when traditional ways were used and implemented by the travel agencies and their affiliated organizations such as airlines and hotels, a lot of time and money was consumed, which could have been used in many other different and more productive ways. Over the past few years, much different software and travel technologies have been developed that are now being used by the travel agencies to improve their efficiency, improve their effectiveness of getting things done, firmly establishing their organization in this extremely competitive world, and earn more profits in the long run.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Before these technologies and software were developed, the traditional ways involved doing everything manually. Now that everything is automated for the constantly growing world of the travel industries, it is a lot easier to keep track of everything. One of the biggest benefits that travel agencies get to enjoy now is constantly being updated about affiliated organizations. A good example of this could be travel agencies having constant updates about the inventories of the airlines and the hotels along with their rates and charges. Having constant updates about the inventories have greatly helped the travel agencies because it helps them to avoid the problem of overbooking and it also helps them to understand the patterns of consumer demands a little better which will help them in coming up with different pricing strategies according to the consumption and demand patterns of the travelers.</span></span></p>\r\n', '', 1, 1, 0, 'image_750x_5e944a47df690.jpg', 1107, '2020-04-13 07:10:51'),

A contact form will not enable your customer to clearly view your products, services, availability of products, or search of products plus make their bookings and direct payment including confirmation of payment and booking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/YWeCKWB2iNW5PTCQL5Ox8Zu1tOnm1snxxf32-Q0wtKB7QaHNKq3zmj6o8-WEtAlhfPmWYfk9ir-bI_Fw952ik9sxf14orhhU-Hf5a9fnTeNbC11ngqtDvqDqSAymWKPyrmpsFTW7\" style=\"height:375px; width:375px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But an online booking engine provides everything that includes product view, search including and booking and payment confirmation to the customers which is called a good customer service.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><u><strong>Minimize your Workload</strong></u></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;re managing your business or agency manually then you should move yourself to an online booking engine that will help you to automate your all tasks like.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Booking should be shown to the customer when they are available.</strong></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Keep your inventories uptodate</strong></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Obtain and save all the information during the booking process and save customer time.</strong></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Send auto booking confirmation email to the customer</strong></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Send payment receipt to customer when they pay online</strong></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Auto Update when booking is processed</strong></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>An online booking engine or system must perform the following functionalities</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/TWve-nOK5yICzViZ9dYIiVuH3O2uTh255m_Sd6PkBpM-9xT_R0gtkoYfIi3uSiUCsG4MWqM1aaaCdWXpQugGRut3GVtdIdMKWr4BeFyIHjLq0lp-pfkBAW6vM-mAR9-8oBTmvlCA\" style=\"height:266px; width:415px\" /></strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><u><strong>Upselling</strong></u></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only large companies or travel agencies are entitled to this possibility, this also includes small and medium size travel companies. When a customer book an online travel or tourism product, it&#39;s very common to offer them an extra option to complement their online purchase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example a basic welcome purchase for apartment or flat rentals,or GPS system for Car rental companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8IOO-AlbuUmlNjxtXL3L8UH5-eoEAX0U5NZNoUEYgxRIrsoWtLoBeQuHSRdhfQBOz2bDMN1RDOmCT4ADKpHCDXQg9bTW_7QQHJAzIFBWqtTEEdf_cQLRPDO0q80nfY4OMoajRLdC\" style=\"height:293px; width:415px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your booking engine should allow you to easily add the complementary products to propose to your customers to differentiate your services and a good service to your customers. This will help you in upselling your services or products.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><u><strong>Discount Promo Codes</strong></u></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Discount codes or promo codes are the best way to promote and boost your business, for example if there is a season of low travel booking services , or there are a few allotments to be sold. Make sure your booking engine has the option of accepting discount or promo codes. This will help us and our customers to enter the promo or discount codes in booking engine and avail discount on travel service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Cz_0EgvAyALMKNIaOR0VZ33FEWw02OwOR1XLlmlOXo3hs3WoJjRlKQc0FFf5qM0OZIn_xQn5frZJ1jaILFMkwJv9MkFFXN55Si5ykzYGyeLoQznUU5SqR0pEMNvucwd2q1aWV2dQ\" style=\"height:429px; width:429px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><u><strong>Online Secure Payment gateways</strong></u></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To avoid different problems, the system or booking engine integrate with a multi currency automated system if you are working internationally. This will help you to reduce the manual work to handle the payments but an automated online payment system will help you for secure payment plus customers also feel secure during online payment because their data is safe and secure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3gVjbOGuFowVrSi2PePwrBC3tkYBtBCK4LFHF4F5R-pzjjcyYzOO-d8CLVWB5x-FlOianARSi71S4Kh97t4AAH6bZn5Rht9CM6S_fmqqaNpbMHIGAPYheZroHAs-V05SBVaXzPe6\" style=\"height:430px; width:430px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><u><strong>Conclusion</strong></u></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are the advantages of having an online booking engine, this will help you to boost your business by converting your visitors into potential customers that will help you to generate the profit.

If you already have an Apple ID created that you&rsquo;d like to use, go ahead and log-in with that Apple ID.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have created your Apple ID, you will also need to enable two-factor authentication on it which is a requirement by Apple for all Apple IDs. It&rsquo;s easiest if you have an Apple device that you can use, but if you don&rsquo;t simply reach out to Apple and they&rsquo;ll be able to help you set that up. You can follow the steps in <a href=\"http://learn.buildfire.com/publishing/apple-specific-articles/how-to-set-up-two-factor-authentication-for-your-apple-developer-account\"><strong>this article</strong></a> to set up two-factor authentication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doing so now will help streamline the rest of the enrollment process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 2: Click &ldquo;Join the Apple Developer Program&rdquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve logged-in, or created a new Apple ID and have logged-in with it at <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://developer.apple.com/</a> you&rsquo;ll see a link titled &ldquo;Join the Apple Developer Program&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://phptravels.com/blog/uploads/images/image_750x415_5f7b1df0a7541.jpg\" style=\"height:415px; width:750px\" />This will take you to a page where Apple tells you all about the developer program. You can read through this if you want, but once you&rsquo;re ready click on the &ldquo;Enroll&rdquo; button.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://phptravels.com/blog/uploads/images/image_750x415_5f7b1e08577bc.jpg\" style=\"height:415px; width:750px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This will take you to a page telling you what the two different account types are, and what you need for each one. These are the two different types of Apple developer accounts:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Individual:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An individual account only allows for a single primary login to be created to the iOS Developer Account. Also, the developer name that will be made public (on the App Store) will be your First and Last name. Sign up for an individual account only if your app is branded to you as an individual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Company/Organization:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A company/organization account allows for multiple user logins to be created and managed with varying permissions capabilities for each login. The developer name that will be made public will be your company or organization&rsquo;s name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enrolling in the correct account, or entity type, is vitally important to getting your app submitted and approved by Apple. Not sure which account type to enroll as? It all boils down to what your app&rsquo;s content is for, and what it&rsquo;s branding is set to.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using Tony Stark of the Avengers as an example, let&rsquo;s say he built an app about himself called &ldquo;Tony Stark&rsquo;s App&rdquo;. Not as creative as his Iron Man suits, but it does the job, and everything in that app is related to him as an individual person. Then he could enroll as an individual. But let&rsquo;s say he made an app for his company Stark Enterprises, or a charitable organization that he created. He&rsquo;d have to enroll as a Company/Organization for that app since it&rsquo;s created specifically for his company or organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enrolling as a Company/Organization will require providing a Dun and Bradstreet number, which we will go over later on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have gone over this information click &ldquo;Start your enrollment&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://phptravels.com/blog/uploads/images/image_750x415_5f7b1e214a208.jpg\" style=\"height:415px; width:750px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 3: Confirm that your email address, name, and Country location is correct, then select the type of account that you&rsquo;re enrolling as</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next you&rsquo;ll be asked to verify your email address, name, and country location then select the account (or entity type) that you&rsquo;re going to enroll as.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://phptravels.com/blog/uploads/images/image_750x415_5f7b1e67196cb.jpg\" style=\"height:415px; width:750px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember, keep in mind what your app is designed for. If your app was built and branded for you as an individual, then you can enroll as an individual. If your app was built and is branded to your company or organization, then you will need to enroll as a Company/Organization. In order to do so, you will need to provide a Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number. If you&rsquo;re uncertain as to whether your business has a DUNS number, then you can check to see <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/enroll/duns-lookup/#!/search\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a DUNS number yet, it is free to get one, and you can obtain one at this <a href=\"http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform/displayHomePage.do\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>page</strong></a>. The process of obtaining one typically takes a couple of weeks.

That page also has instructions for organizations outside of the United States.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce you have a DUNS number, you can provide it to Apple during the enrollment process with Apple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 4: Enter in your contact information and read through the agreement at the bottom of the page</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the next screen you&rsquo;ll be asked to fill out the contact information for your account:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://phptravels.com/blog/uploads/images/image_750x415_5f7b1ec1f0abe.jpg\" style=\"height:415px; width:750px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After that you&rsquo;ll be asked to read through the Apple developer account agreement.

Once you&rsquo;ve done this click Continue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 6: Decide if you want Automatic Renewal&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next you&rsquo;ll be brought to a screen telling you how much the enrollment fee will cost and it&rsquo;s duration. You&rsquo;ll also have the option to enable automatic renewal which will help you if you&rsquo;d like to not worry about renewing your plan each year.

If your travel agency is still relying on outdated spreadsheets and obsolete tools in this era, it&rsquo;s high time you need to upgrade.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want your online travel agency to make the best out of the revolutionary trends, you have to switch towards a more rationalized approach. Modernize your website and focus on your core aptitudes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There exists an excess of excellent tech tools in the market that can help you streamline operations, enhance your agency&rsquo;s productivity, and improve your customer experience.&nbsp;This article covers all the essential tech tools for your online travel agency, so you can efficiently manage different operations of your business.&nbsp;Best Tech Tools for Online Travel Agencies</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the management of tasks and operations, supervising expenses to the successful transfer of clients&rsquo; data into systems, a high-profile travel agency tends to have the most organized workflows. The efficiency of task management is what makes a travel agency gain success. So, let&rsquo;s get started with the essential tech tools that every online travel agency should use.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Online Booking Services</strong></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>The current pandemic has made people more conscious and most clients are now inclined towards the online booking. Therefore, it is now essential for OTAs to provide online booking services by investing in an efficient online booking engine so the clients can book directly on your website.&nbsp; So, here is our recommendation for the best online booking engine you can choose for your agency.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://phptravels.com/\">P</a><a href=\"http://phptravels.com\">HPTRAVELS </a>have stepped forward to support their partners from the travel industry by offering budget-friendly services. With the majority of the countries resuming their flight operations in the pandemic situation, many customers now prefer online booking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PHPtravels booking engine enables the agencies to retail their live inventory to B2C clients and B2B agents. It&rsquo;s the most suitable booking engine for OTAs that have their private inventory, as it permits you to assimilate your third-party XML providers to offer aggregated packages for flights, ground transportation, activities, and hotels on your webpage. It also allows you to sell your custom-made contracts including hotels, transport, activities, and tours on the same platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It contains a potent back-office module so you can manage expenses, distributions, promotions, client data, shortlist agents, and get thorough business reports. PHPTravels supports multiple currencies and languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>White Label Solutions</strong></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>If your travel agency doesn&rsquo;t own its inventory of flights, hotels, or other facilities, you can opt for a white label solution to trade your services to B2C customers online. A con of going for white labels is that the client is redirected to the white label provider&rsquo;s webpage for reservation, and you lose control over the pricing and other features. The coupons and tickets don&rsquo;t advertise or carry your brand name. So, here is what we recommend for white label solutions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Booking.com</strong></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Small-business agencies that do not have the amenity of hotel inventory through APIs or direct contracts can link themselves with this Hotel Affiliate Package to retail hotel suites and rooms on their webpage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Assimilating this platform&rsquo;s search widget into your webpage, allows you to enable your clients to pick from more than 2.5 million properties, and in return, you can earn a handsome commission on every booking through your website.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Travelpayouts</strong></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This is another suitable choice for small travel agencies seeking the retail of flights and hotels via their website. You can assimilate Travelpayout&rsquo;s widget into your website. This enables the clients to search live inventory on your site before being redirected for booking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep in mind that every online travel agency needs different integration. To know which integration technology suite your OTA the most, you can get connected with <a href=\"https://phptravels.com/\">PHPTravels </a>which is one of the best white label affiliate software providers we found out there.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>CRM Tools</strong></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have this misconception that the sole purpose of a CRM is to keep a record of the clients&rsquo; date of birth, you might need to reconsider. CRM is an important tool that allows &nbsp; you to customize your services and makes it fairly easy to organize your inquiries, leads, and clients in one place. Here is what we suggest in the CRM category:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Zoho CRM</strong></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>HubSpot CRM</strong></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Digital Marketing Tools</strong></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Managing your online line travel portal is what plays the key role. You need to invest in good digital marketing to gain a notable digital presence. This helps your business gain increased traffic, leads, and potential clients. Here is our recommendation for your digital marketing strategy:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>SEMRush</strong></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Managing an online travel agency is like an arena, and it&rsquo;s important to keep observation on your key competitors in the market to make sure you stay ahead of them in your marketing strategies. SEMrush is one of the most useful and suitable tools for this purpose. It offers a detailed observation of your business rival&rsquo;s digital presence, including their insights, and the ratio of organic versus paid traffic. It also tells you the target keywords of your competitor, their best backlinks, and more about their marketing techniques.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"5\">\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Accounting Tools</strong></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Accounting tools are essential for all small-scale and big online travel agencies. It&rsquo;s time you move ahead of spreadsheets and other outdated means to manage your business finances. For this purpose, we recommend:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Quickbooks</strong></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Quickbooks is specifically designed keeping in view the needs of small and mid-sized businesses. It is a completely web-based accounting tool that enables you to manage and organize all your agency&rsquo;s investments and expenses in one place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It helps you get rid of complex spreadsheets and helps you manage all your accounts, payments, billing, expense tracking, and every other financial task easily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The web-based operation makes it fairly user-friendly as you can manage it on your mobile as well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What to Look For in a Travel Agency Software?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To run a successful online travel agency, you need to invest in the best Travel Agency Software that comes with multiple tools.&nbsp; An efficient tool like <a href=\"https://phptravels.com/\">PHPTravels</a> covers the majority of your travel technology needs. It provides online booking of hotels, cabs, and taxis. It also supports multi-lingual dealing and multiple currencies along with the provision of lifetime updates.

It’s one of the world’s largest online travel portals, which supports people for selling tours online.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">The question that arises is how can you stand out? Where should you designate your resources? Let’s check out some of the best advertising channels for tour operators. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">What are the promotion platforms for tour operators to sell tours online?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Before choosing your channels, it’s essential to comprehend how your customers tend to buy and the places where they obtain information. You probably have a great idea about this already but if you don’t – ask how they found out about your tour.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">That said, there are some obvious platforms you should reconsider. Below is an overview of the most efficient  channels for selling tours online:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://phptravels.com/blog/uploads/images/image_750x415_605f23ccab3be.jpg\" style=\"height:415px; width:750px\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><strong>Online Travel Agencies (OTAs)</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">OTAs sum thousands of offers in one place so consumers can filter and compare travel products on a single website. Therefore, sites like Viator and GetYourGuide are extremely familiar with tourists and flourish millions of monthly visits.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Of course, gaining access to them comes at a price – OTAs typically charge commission fees between 15% and 30% of your ticket price. And they usually ask you to provide your lowest price so people buy through their program instead of your website or offline channels.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">As such, OTAs are a great option in two specific cases:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">1) You need to fill out your capacity as your costs don’t progress with each additional customer (e.g. filling out bus seats).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">2) You are just starting and need to boost awareness of your tour even if you sacrifice part of your profit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">So it’s usually best to prioritize your direct channels over OTAs but reconsider getting listed with a few of them, particularly to sell last-minute tickets that would otherwise go to dissipate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://phptravels.com/blog/uploads/images/image_750x415_605f23cd820fa.jpg\" style=\"height:415px; width:750px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><strong>Social media</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">To be fair, people are normally NOT in buying mode when browsing their Facebook or Instagram feed. However, social networks are good places to build knowledge of your tour and work well as referral sources when your current customers tag themselves and upload photos.  Also, advertising on sites like Facebook is highly customizable based on your customers’ location and interests, making it reasonable to show your offers to a very targeted audience.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">While they are not as effective (or cheap) as they used to be, social networks like Facebook are deserving testing as an effective channel for your offers.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://phptravels.com/blog/uploads/images/image_750x415_605f23ce63f7d.jpg\" style=\"height:415px; width:750px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><strong>Google</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">There’s a lot you can do about it including creating important content and paying for search ads.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">While these tactics are helpful, big OTAs and TripAdvisor normally control search results and you’ll need to get very particular if you want a chance of reaching your target audience.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">However, there’s one completely free and very effective service to utilize the power of Google search – Google My Business.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">If you’re not already using this, your tour will not show up on Google Maps hence you will lose out on possible customers who search for terms like “best tours in [your city]”.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Overall, Google should be a big part of your marketing strategy and one great place to start is a professional listing on Google My Business.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://phptravels.com/blog/uploads/images/image_750x415_605f23cb098f6.jpg\" style=\"height:415px; width:750px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><strong>TripAdvisor</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">You’re probably getting much of your business from TripAdvisor already but some things can help you make even bigger use of it:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">– Understanding the TripAdvisor algorithm: your listing is more likely to show up large in the results when you have good reviews and plenty of them. But did you know you should also have a constant number of reviews? Also, TripAdvisor takes into account recency, meaning that listings with more recent reviews are prioritized over ones with older/infrequent reviews, everything else being equivalent.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://phptravels.com/blog/uploads/images/image_750x415_605f23cbd847f.jpg\" style=\"height:415px; width:750px\" /><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><strong>Partners and Influencers</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">You can often discover good partnerships with local businesses and influencers where you refer businesses to each other or cooperate on a commission basis.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">One of the best ways to build such partnerships is your local Destination Management Organization (DMO). DMOs work to promote tourism in a region so they often produce large networks of local businesses and visitor services. This makes them a large partner who can sell your services and introduce you to other regional businesses that can cross-promote your offers.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">Influencers, on the other hand, are bloggers, bloggers, and people with big social media followings who can review your tour and partake it with their audience. Some can prove to be remarkably valuable but be careful with people who claim to be famous when they simply want to get a free tour or advertising payment. Try to arrange deals where you only pay per lead or customer from their campaign.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://phptravels.com/blog/uploads/images/image_750x415_605338847462b.jpg\" style=\"height:415px; width:750px\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">There are two broad aspects to a successful tour business – your value statement and your market. Having a great value proposition is wasted unless you blend it with the right promotion channels. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">In this article, we looked at the top platforms to support a tour business online. Each channel can be further broken down into individual platforms and websites which you can experiment with. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">For example, there are many OTA websites you can choose from – the best one will depend on your geography and who your ideal customers are.
