### Welcome ðŸ‘‹ to BLOG SCRIPT

The story behind blog script. 
We all know when it comes to blogging or content sharing the only option we have is wordpress. [ which I wonder why. because everyone can write CMS script code but ]

Same in my case whenever I wanted to build a blog site I have no great options but thanks to recent innovation people made for example. 
you can start now cloud based blog on medium.com and map your domain without buying any fancy hosting or you can go with ghost.org another great option to start blogging with or 
if you are looking to write your product documentation we have amazing product called gitbook.com which can be very handy to write your documentation and map your sub domain 
to your online docs. So why I indent to write my own code and waste so much of my time ? Ehhmmm. good question. 

Let me think :D  !!! 
Ah I got the answer because every platform listed above is very tricky to configure. from installation management to customization. some even do not allow you to customize for 
example we have medium.com you can customize enought to make things your own way. you cant add your snippets or eidgets. ghost.org is super fast but the configuration and 
installation specially when it comes to SSL its seriously hell to manage. 

Working with all the available technologies and paltform I became to this conclusion because every platform is looking to scale out of their own nichey they use to build such 
infrastructure which is not only hard to understand but hell when it comes to customize. 

And that's the main reason of writting my own blog script specially in php mysql and simple html css js because its simple to understand easy to customize and scalable to any
level of your requirements. 

The blog script comes with pre-configurations. you don't need to buy or install any fancy plugins anymore find some useful features below.
